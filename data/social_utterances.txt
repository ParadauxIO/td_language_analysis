So the choice of Government is either Fianna Fáil, Fianna Gael or a Gino Kenny government is it? So you are happy with another round of fianna Gael and fianna fáil just so long as it's not Gino Kenny?
You here Gino Kenny as having a middle-class southside accent?
Just thinking about people before profit
What happened to Gino Kenny?
Gino Kenny looks under pressure, got very few transfers from O'Broin
Gino Kenny the ‘grow yer own’ dude, haven’t heard of him for around 5 year
Look at Paul Murphy, Boyd Barrett, Gino Kenny etc
All of them are suffering from some form of male pattern baldness
There also all under 6 ft
Do these people simply have weak genetics?
He will come in around the 4,000 mark thanks to a left vote transfer pact This is an interesting constituency in my view
I suppose Dowds could get it from Tuffy's transfers, but Gino Kenny looks like he has a real shot at it
Him and his canvassers have been outside Superquinn for 3 weeks in a row
Can you hazard a guess were FG's support went? Do you think it went to PBP maybe? And were did FF get it's rise, Gino Kenny's loss?
And Gino Kenny getting death threats
And him and Cllr Vincent Jackson spoke out this week about the harassment
Many other public reps havent spoken publicly about all the harassment they are getting on social media
Gino Kenny is going to struggle to retain his seat too
If they're voting against the sanctions that cut off the flow of money to russia they are implicitly supporting those billions
What you think about Gino Kenny and his hash dealings is irrelevant
Absolutely agree, MM legacy will be the annihilation of the FF parliamentary party at the next election
There’s no national interest there, we know whose interest is being looked after
But FF have no one to blame only themselves, they should have heaved against him long ago and tried to rebuild and regenerate their party
They didn’t, they still won’t, and history will be their reward but not in a good way
They come across as a bunch of whiners now, and not an action in site
FG will come through this coalition rather better than the others, and it’s easy to see why
Yes indeed, there were many of us who couldn't see Sinn Fein doing better than 20%
I have to admit to being one of those
It was thanks to a huge blindspot
I mistakenly believed that Ireland was immune to the Brexit/Trump effect of people voting for idiotic ideas put forward by idiotic politicians
That was a fatal mistake
It remains to be seen how long this trend lasts, but if Sinn Fein get into power in Ireland, it will be the equivalent of Trump and Boris coming to power
Yes, I did read about the Golfgate scandal
But did you read about the consequences that befell those who broke the Covid rules in Clifden? An EU Commissioner was forced to resign - a very unusual occurrence
A government minister resigned too - again an unusual occurrence
And other TDs were forced to resign from leadership positions in the Oireachtas
They broke the rules and were rightly punished
That is similar to what would happen to anybody who breaks the rules
What did you want to happen to them? Should they be tarred and feathered? Imprisoned? Executed perhaps? And I don't revere politicians
I simply think they're people like everyone else just attempting to do their job and sometimes screwing up
I don't lavish hysterical praise on them when they do the right thing, but neither do I damn them to hell or indulge in childish generalised attacks on them when they screw up
People voted for alternatives because FF/FG don't care about anybody but themselves
There were no solutions proposed by Sinn Fein on any of those things
And you as a Green Voter are happy with how the Greens jumped in bed with FF/FG and the housing policy hasn't changed?
It's not the republican vote that's transferring; it's the populist vote
The 'something for everyone in the audience' vote
SF did very poorly in the Locals and Euros in 2019, as well as the 2018 Presidential vote
They identified that the big issue is rent prices, standards of accommodation and the difficulty in purchasing a house
They targeted this very strongly from Sept 2019 onwards, developing a new housing policy that resonates with a lot of people
They promised lower rents and cheaper starter homes
Health was a secondary issue, the health crisis only affects those who are ill, so for most people it's secondary
I'd argue that a true 'republican/United Ireland' vote in Ireland is relatively small as most people are happy enough with the status quo
The black & tan commemoration issue hit a note with some people, SF recognised this and it hardened their vote with some people
People in every country want great services at low tax rates, (which isn't possible), SF promise this, it's something that FF specialised on for years and they have cornered that particular share of the vote
Kate O'Connell was brought in to target Lucinda Creighton's seat in 2016
She got soft interviews and colour pieces in the Sindo 3 weeks running before the election and she appealed to a certain demographic in Dublin Bay South that FG were looking to target
She achieved very little as TD, but believed due to her family connections that she had a right to the seat
Alas, the plebs of Dublin Bay South found the others more attractive and Kate was told to do one
Murphy is there a lot longer than O'Connell, both as an active party member and as a politician (local and Dail)
He's a close confidant of Leo's and when FG realised that they weren't getting two seats, they had to ensure they got at least one, hence the favoritism towards Murphy
Murphy had done a poor job on housing, but most importantly, he had delivered for FG's backers (the co-living scheme is a wet dream for developers and investors)
A buffoon of the highest order with no actual understanding of issues he campaigns about
The bills he has tried to introduce have been torn to shreds by people who actually understand the issues
A professional protestor and nay-sayer who offers nothing of value to Irish politics
Can't even dress himself properly when attending the Dáil
An embarrassment
We need to change the law on cannabis and euthanasia
It's just that Gino isn't the man to get these things done or even propose coherent private member's bills that can be a starting point for the government to legislate
thats the kind of bill that would have Liveline - Joe Duffy in calls for six months , the idea of " killing off Granny " would be hyped to the max and FF politicians etc would go running scared
Diarmuid O Cadhla, I'd be loath to call him a politican though somehow he was co-opted onto Cork City Council some years ago, now gone thankfully
A cretin and utter waster up there with Gemma and Waters
You must have got a ‘blown can’ of Bonio,dog?
He's an idiot, I've posted this before - I was in school with him and he was the guy who sat in the back of the class eating his own snot whilst the rest of us got on with it
He's dim as fcuk
Other than actually dealing cannabis the only way he'd ever earn €100k a year is being TD
You may have not detected the sarcasm when I used the word attack
The whole thread has been about attacking the right
I said the left is insane
On balance the left has hardly had a glove laid on the
Boo hoo
I have no inclination towards the far left or the far right
I have a go at the left here because no one else does, because the left has countless cheerleaders who have their heads in the sand about the realities of wing nuts like Paul Murphy and Gino Kenny and their insane rhetoric
You and your pals made this thread about "I know someone is right wing when, ha ha ha" type nonsense pages ago and then you have a go at me for offering a tiny measure of balance
You want everything your own way and throw your toys out of the pram when someone says one thing about your precious left wing loonies
For clarification once again, I detest the far left and the far right, I despair at anyone supporting either of them
Are you suggesting that I'm far right Tony? Where's your evidence of this
And no, your opinion won't suffice
Further to this, there's a thread in feedback about what's wrong with this site currently
This is a prime example of it, a thread descends into an echo chamber of ridiculing something, whoever turns up with a differing opinion has to deal with being quoted by multiple posters at a time being accused of being an extremist and it's all OK because the incumbent lefties are the ones doing it
Libertarians aren't extreme right, they are classic liberals but don't worry, we haven't a single libertarian in the Dail
Libertarians think they're classical liberals
But other people, who also think they're classical liberals, think that libertarians aren't
It's a contested space
Regardless, libertarians tend to be very right-wing on economic matters
Though they have a generally restrictive view of the role of the state, they tend to make an exception when it comes to property rights; in their view it absolutely is the role of the state to defend and vindicate, up to and including by force, the rights of private property
And they tend to take a very expansive view of what the rights of private property are
This means, in effect, that the primary role of the state is to serve the interests of the wealthy
And, broadly speaking, that's a pretty right-wing position, and it tends to align well with right-wing positions held by people who aren't libertarians
So liberterians can meaningfully be classified as pretty far to the right on the usual left-right political spectrum
On social matters, they may take quite left-wing or progressive stances, but qualified by their libertarianism
Thus they'll affirm your right to get an abortion — provided you can pay for it
Indeed, they'll affirm your right to get any healthcare you can afford
They're quite relaxed about you burning the flag, provided it's your flag you burn
You've bought and paid for it? Burn away, so
But there are other socially progressive positions that they reject
Libertarians are generally uncomfortable about equal treatment legislation, for example
If the owner of a coffee shop wants to refuse service to black people, or to serve them only if they sit in a designated area, in the libertarian view he should be free to do so; it is an infringement on his rights as a business owner to dictate that he cannot discriminate on the grounds of race, gender, etc
Libertarians might be liberal socially, but be they certainly would not be liberal economically speaking
Same problem though: if there isn't the appetite for such a party, then there isn't a party; and if there is the appetite then what's stopping someone from starting up such a party?
Your a fairly constant apologist for the hard right elements of Irish society, so not hard right yourself but certainly show sympathy for it
None of the TD,s mentioned are libertarian on the economy, Verona Murphy aside , the others are pork barrell politicians
You also forgot to mention that libertarians are very pro immigration
Unless one's definition of hard right is everyone who's not a socialist ?, any inclusion of libertarianism with the hard right is plain preposterous
Libertarianism is the economic equivalent of drinking bleach
Why would anyone want libertarian TDs?
They are narcassist's pretending to be liberals
That doesn't make them hard right, just means they aren't socialists
Link to where I said the Irish are racist?
When people are talking about not liking the change in how people look in their towns, what do they mean?
You may want to ignore the racism some Irish people have and pretend it's not there but in the real world, foreign nationals are getting abused, buildings for asylum seekers are being burnt down, some are stating they don't want any immigrants of a certain colour to be allowed into Ireland and some are calling Irish people of a different colour as not being from here
And who are you speaking for when you say most of us?
I think of libertarianism as politics for people who are on the autistic spectrum but don't know it, basically
It's hugely individualistic and has no time for the concept of the common good
It basically attaches zero value to social and communal relationships; social inclusion rather than alienation; etc
Libertarians basically want the maximum freedom with the minimum obligations, they are the very definition of the antisocial neighbour
Context of the conversation revolved around libertarians being lumped in with the " hard right"
Q you detailing why they aren't liberals ( they are liberals, it's just the prevailing liberal strand today are progressives )
There's validity to what you say
"Left" and "right" are relative positions
Describing these terms relative you my (or your) own beliefs would be nonsense
We could describe them in relation to Irish politics, or in relation to politics in other countries
The point of the article that kicked off this thread is that some people feel there's a lack of options in Ireland for those who aren't left-leaning
To evaluate that assertion, a comparison to other countries makes more sense
Imagine I was describing some party in some other country
Would you think this party is left- or right- leaning? I'm talking about what has been done since they came to power in 2011, not their historic reputation or what some of their traditional supporters would like
I'm not saying any particular one of these things is wrong, but it's laughable to say they're the actions of a right-wing party
Being led for years (up to this week) by an openly gay multiracial leader
Maintained "the most progressive system of taxes and transfers of any OECD member" (https://www
org/gov/gov-at-a-glance-2021-ireland
Increased public spending by almost 60% over the past 10 years (Site favicon Ireland Government Spending
), while consistently increasing government debt (Site faviconIreland national debt - Economics Help
Having a 50% marginal tax rate kicking in for very mediocre incomes
Managed the introduction of same-sex marriage, abortion, with a hate-speech law on the way
Refused to discuss any limit to the level of inward migration to the country and for years did not enforce deportations of people found to have arrived illegally
Only starting to discuss it now
I'm sure there's more, but if we were describing some party in the UK, USA, Australia, Germany etc, where would you think this party lies on the spectrum?
There's loads
The issue is that everyone who tries to define what they want from a right wing party only ever has one thing in common which is "not the ones that are already there"
And yet when people are pushed to list what they want from a right or centre right party, they almost always list one absolutely bonkers thing that only the existing collection of far right parties would ever support (and in many cases is either unconstitutional or against international law)
I normally have a smoke from time to time, i haven't smoked it since July
My sleep isn't as good since
It definitely gives you a deeper sleep, saying that i'd be a bit hazey for a few hours the next day after i get up
The stuff being sold in the head shops was dangerous tho, didn't a few people die from that garbage they sold? maybe i'm mistaken
The above is simply not true, it does not give you a better sleep either does alcohol,
Its a different kind of sleep than normal sleep its a sedated sleep which in the long term is horrifically bad for you
You do not reach REM (dream sleep ) from Drinking or smoking sleep , your body needs REM so much so that if you don't get it during sleep and deprive it from your body long enough you will start to get it when you are awake,
Have you ever seen a homeless wineo in a park talking to himself and shouting at nothing, That's caused by never getting his dream sleep due to alcohol abuse so he is hallucinating during the day,
Almost all weed smoker who quite report that they start to have crazy vivid dreams when they sleep
Its due to never getting to the required depth of sleep while smoking weed,
I've been smoking weed since i was about 16 or 17, some of those years i had a smoke most days of the week
Everything you have just said has not been experienced by me
I get a great nights sleep after having a smoke
I don't know where you read that but it's news to me and it could well be true in some cases
Would this be your justification for keeping cannabis illegal?
No i say make it legal
These are side effect for people who abuse Cannabis and Alcohol ,
If your an adult and responsible there shouldn't be an issue,
You can abuse food and become obese i don't see anyone calling for food to be banned,
You can drive a car into a ditch or a bunch of people,
There are a hundred things in life you can abuse and they will cause problems that are not banned,
Its all about being a responsible adult
Head shops sold synthetic ****
There should be some form of legalisation but as you said ignorance will stop it
My parents would be of the mind that cannabis is similar to heroin and you would be surprised how many people think that
In Ireland most people smoke cannabis mixed with tobacco and its the tobacco that causes most of the issues
Stop the tobacco and its way better
Obviously smoking anything is bad for lungs but without tobacco its much better
Also the cravings you get when you give up are can be more for the tobacco not the cannabis
There is an illuminating documentary on Netflix that was put together by an Australian journalist, called "A Life of Its Own: The Truth About Medical Marijuana"
It discusses in detail the whole misconceptions and historic stigma against cannabis and reasons why medical trials and tests have been buried for the past 80 years
However, it also has interviews with those who have carried out studies (some illegal) in Israel, the "real life" benefits of individuals for all kinds of medical problems that the plethora of "conventional" drugs that big pharma companies produce couldn't/wouldn't solve, without massive side effects
I urge you to watch it
It just might change your misguided perceptions
Real life stuff
We need to get as much money out of these dealers hands as possible, we need to examine the policies in Switzerland and Portugal and see what they are doing right, because we've seen multiple murders in the first 3 months of this year already
Or you could provide links to the studies they are basing their opinions on
Not gonna waste a couple of hours of my life on a movie misrepresenting studies i've all ready read
Cannabis has been shown to have a minor benefit for 3 or 4 conditions
That's were the science stands at the moment
Unless this movie has some new research in it , i don't see any point in it
On a side note , Gino Kenny has said weed will be available on prescription in a few months
Look like the government has managed to find a supplier
I wont be providing any links to studies
Although many are quoted during the programme, that were not acted upon, even 20 years ago
I am pointing to a program that contains evidence presented by learned people that have done and have been doing research since the 60's, particularly in Israel by Professor Raphael Mechoulam, he was the one that isolated THC and CBD
The program also has first hand testimonials by medical users and professionals
As ive already said, i'm familiar with the research that is available
I'll change my perception if you provide some evidence
Not a documentary
I'm not aware of any research that shows weed to effective in anything other than the 3 or 4 conditions stated in the American Acadamies review
The most comphrensive review to date
If i'm wrong should be easy for you to provide a link
Cannabis should be legal for a multitude of reasons, it should be regulated for a multitude of reasons too
I have smoked on and off since 15
I don't enjoy alcohol and weed is a great alternative for some people (not all)
Like anything, if you over use/abuse it you will have negative effects
I'll list some of my reasons for legalisation, not an exhaustive list by any means:
-taking the criminal aspect out of it will have a few benefits
Reduce trafficking, putting the profits and taxes into the pocket of government allows the coffers to fill and be put to use on the greater good rather than going into making the trafficking more sophisticated and drug dealers richer
Obviously would free up courts/police/prison resources
It stops average Joe like me, who are otherwise law abiding being criminalised by a personal choice which would harm nobody else
I could carry on here but this part would get too long
-people say it's a "gateway" drug
I've never smoked weed and suddenly thought "love a bit of heroin now"
The reason it's a gateway drug is because, and this may come as a surprise, if you want weed you have to get it from a drug dealer
Generally these people don't limit themselves to a single product, or they know people who can get harder drugs
Putting it in a regulated shop scenario means that pathway is no longer as easy
-people say legalisation will lead to zombie stoners wandering the earth
This has not become the case in any place where legalisation or decriminalisation as occurred
By that logic we should all be alcoholic no? I have a degree, have travelled a lot, no major debts, long term steady relationship, excellent employment history, no criminal record, would generally consider myself a decent person
I never went to work stoned, just like I never went to work drunk, although I have been in work after heavy nights drinking and probably still legally classed as drunk, which is considered normal or even as a badge of honour by some
-there are proven medical benefits for some conditions
It doesn't cure cancer contrary to the Facebook doctors however there is strong scientific and anecdotal evidence that it can be a massively helpful treatment or alternative treatment for some medical conditions
This is not made up, as you can see from some first hand experience in this thread
-psychological problems can be caused by abuse for sure
This is true for many substances widely available today, including a lot of legal prescription/over the counter medicine
Education is key here
Allowing people to indulge in too much of any substance, even caffeine, can cause negative effects
It's down to responsible use at an individual level
People tend to hide the fact they smoke weed outside of a trusted circle and this can lead to a bad set of circumstances for someone with underlying mental health issues
-drug dealers generally don't know the chemical composition of what they sell
Certain strains of weed have different chemical balances that can effect people in different ways in specific circumstances
Having a lab type setup will allow for a consistent product and people can chose what suits them best
This would significantly help with the mental aspect as people can choose what suits them and be consistent in that choice
Also the practice of adding weight to the product using whatever means possible will disappear, removing a hugely dangerous aspect of weed
This post is already significantly longer than I wanted it to be, and I could continue for pages more, but I won't
To finish on a personal note, I find being criminalised for a personal choice to be almost a violation of human rights
A slight exaggeration maybe, but the fact that people can drink until they drop, which brings massive social/economic/health problems to this country and because it's the norm people don't bat an eyelid
In fact it's applauded sometimes, people finding it hilarious that someone can't remember the night before is insane in my opinion
Weed has never made me blackout, and is generally something equivalent to a glass of wine in the evening rather than 8 hours of binge drinking hard spirits
Some people, given the opportunity, will abuse whatever substance they can get their hands on regardless of the legality
As I said previously, the key is education, regulation and, importantly, moderation
How is it confirmation bias, assuming the movie is based on the same research already covered by the numerous reviews that all came to the same conclusions why would i watch it?
If it has new research in it just provide a link
I'd get more useful info from the research paper than the movie
The poster mustn't be too confident that the movie represents the facts if afraid to provide links to clinical trials
Fine Gael represents big business interests ahead of ordinary workers, corporate landlords & vulture funds ahead of renters, & private health corporations, not ordinary people's health

Gino kenny is the one who introduced the bill?
Gino Kenny

Sure, let's do what he says
Gino Kenny @ginosocialist
probably needed a hit off the crack pipe after that
was wondering who it might have been that was lobbying Gino Kenny on assisted dying and I have a feeling it might have been Janie Lazar
She has 'Specialist Speaker Coach and StoryWeaver' in her Linkedin
Sounds like someone who could sell sand to the Arabs

Not true
It’s a Private Members Bill Sponsored by: Richard Boyd Barrett; Mick Barry; Gino Kenny; Bríd Smith; Paul Murphy

He’s still under the illusion that pbs are necessary for kids
But he’s blocked me so I can’t!!!

Gino Kenny 2023: "Throw Granny out of the nursing home, make way for 20 year old males from safe countries"

What error rate is acceptable when the aim is to cause death?
Drinks Ireland have done a lobbying return on meeting Robert Watt
How many public health groups are getting meetings with the Sec Gen of the DoH??
@cllr_ginokenny
goes straight in with the question: has the minister been lobbied by industry? Minister has met IBEC on reformulation, "responsible marketing" and labelling
Indeed, we know IBEC meet DoH officials regularly
They're wanking themselves silly over this 😂
Whatever side of the debate you're on, scarlet for posting that
Murphy stood there standing his ground the whole time
Like when they went after Gino Kenny at the roundabout
Literally just lying about things you can see in videos
Everyone is saying im  a landlord witch im not so i went to the  man who spreads the lies paul murphy  and called him out to his face and he went white no point in reporting him as the state gives him special privilege in the dail to say whatever he wants  #irelandisfull
Thanks to Gino Kenny TD and Mark Kerins - PBP Lucan and all the others who came out to support tenants facing eviction and all those already homeless
've seen many motions and debates on homelessness, drug reform, hospital crisis, immigration and evictions with hardly anyone from the government present
How many @greenparty_ie
members were present for Gino Kenny's Cannabis proposal last week?
our kids are dropping out of school, WHY? Because the likes of Gino Kenny want to decriminalise drugs and that will lead to harder drugs!!"
???? Gino Kenny wanting to decrim drugs makes kids drop out? This guy is hardly yer top man is he?
Literally the only good thing that gino Kenny does is the cannabis legalisation stuff he should stick to that and only that and have much more support

IRELAND
Despite a cross party committee and a Citizens' Assembly both recommending identical reforms in drugs policy, the government wants another committee and a delay until after the election
And they wonder why no one trusts politicians anymore!

On the other hand the absense of a combined collective of those in favour makes the case for decrim and regulation to look weak
Kudos to Pb4P, Gino Kenny and members of Labour and GP in the open support but that's no way near enough
User aren't 'patients' - abusers are
'These doctors have equated 7 grams of cannabis with four bottles of vodka
Hold on, four bottles of vodka would kill you and not only you but your family as well
Are they joking? Are they actually serious?'
Fair play to People Before Profit TD Gino Kenny for putting cute hoor Danny Healy-Rae in his place, over the Bill to decriminalise simple possession
Kenny said ‘It's incredible that Healy-Rae says cannabis is a gateway drug - he owns a pub!’ The backwards brothers in Kerry have…
A very positive sign
'Cannabis' was trending in Ireland yesterday during & after Gino Kenny's Cannabis Bill debate
Government should take note of how this issue matters to so many people & TDs who spoke against reform should consider which side of history they stand on
Gino Kenny is trying his best to get some kind of regulation and normalisation of cannabis in the long term
It may not be what people want,
but it’s a start
I hope the bill is passed into law and not watered down - reform is slow - at least the conversation is happening
Social Democrats TD Garry Gannon strongly supported Gino Kenny's bill
He stated that decriminalisation should be central to drugs policy, and that it should be combined with investment and resourcing
Labour Party TD Aodhán O'Riordáin strongly supported Gino Kenny's bill
He stated in relation to cannabis legalisation:
'The Labour Party believes in the legalisation and regulation of cannabis'
Sinn Féin's Justice Spokesperson Pa Daly said that Gino Kenny's bill had some issues and that it was 'not the finished product'
He suggested that the bill should be passed by Government to stage 3 for further debate and to 'tease out' its problems
The bill would have decriminalised cannabis for possession as long as it was under 7 grams
Introduced by Gino Kenny, he sought extensive legal advice when writing the bill to ensure it was in line with EU and international law
‘It's incredible that he says cannabis is a gateway drug - he owns a pub’ – Gino Kenny hits out at Danny Healy-Rae in Dáil
Government delay Gino Kenny's decriminalisation of cannabis bill going to 3rd stage for 9 months, ie no chance of passing the 5 stages necessary before a General Election comes along and kills it
wants hash legalised because he smokes enough of it FACT he’s only a step away from being a junky how the fcuk are people like him in politics and Eileen Flynn what has happened to Ireland 🇮🇪🙄
Gino Kenny's Bill surely? He's been trying to legalise cannabis for medicinal use since he got in the door of Leinster House in 2016 through a Private Members Bill
I know you're saying it's to legalise small amounts for personal use, but surely this stems from Gino?
Speaking on Gino Kenny's cannabis bill, being brought forward next week, Drugs Minister Hildegarde Naughton said:
'My door is open, my viewpoint is open in relation to this' but added 'what might seem like a really good idea
it might have particular unintended consequences'
Leo Varadkar today said that the prohibition of drugs has not worked, and has been 'largely rejected by the public'
He is absolutely correct
He now has an obligation to match these strong words with action, and he can start by supporting Gino Kenny's cannabis bill next week
BP's Gino Kenny using his slot to ask if the govt will take the recommendations of the Citizens Assembly on drug use, whose final report is published tomorrow
"The status quo of criminalization does not work," Kenny says
People Before Profit TD Gino Kenny says he is calling on the government to expand the Medicinal Cannabis Access Programme (MCAP) so that it includes neuropathic pain in light of a report conducted by the Health Research Board
Gino Kenny wealthy?
I don't think so
In fact he refused to take the full salary that was available to him
Gino Kenny TD was on the Irish Canna Clinic podcast to discuss his upcoming cannabis bill
2 abreast is still perfectly legal, and good riding
You'll find that out when you learn to drive properly
In the meantime, cry more, and take your grievance up with the traffic cops
Be sure and come back and tell us what they say
He's following the advice in the highway code
Meanwhile the driver is using a phone while driving
Do you condone drunk driving too?
Perhaps get some tuition if you're unable to see the problem road user here
They've paid their taxes, they can use all of the road
You have a broken lane divider, you can go around them, stop having a little cry and just deal with it, there are bigger problems in life
And at this point, the driver claimed it was a "Dashcam"
That's absolutely fine, Paul
Take a look at my pinned tweet thread
Typical
They  own the road
They pay no tax
They don't obey the rules of the road
Watch them race through red lights
And if they knock a pedestrian down, they just cycle away because nobody can identify them
And they don't have insurance
I rest my case
They ignore YOU not 'us'
PWD is are not a homogeneous community ,we don't all want to be associated with the likes of Gino Kenny with his eugenics and frankly you sound unhinged
Like what your comrade Gino Kenny is doing about bringing euthanasia in for the disabled Bernard?
agree but it’s never going to stop everyone! I like to cycle and I cycle in a way that takes into consideration some of the worst motorists out their, you have to factor it in, people who ride motorbikes do 👍
Pass in the other lane when it is safe to do so
Are you too lazy to move the steering wheel a teeny bit you snowflake?
In Spain, he would have already lost his license for driving while pretending to be a reporter with a camera in his hand
No I didn't
You know so
I think you're just being a tad pedantic
OK Colin, you obviously like to sit in a darkened room trying your best to find error
You're failing, rapidly
Best to remain silent and be thought of as a fool than open your mouth and remove all doubt
You appear quite determined to remove all doubt
Could he in any circumstances safely overtake there or does the Highway Code tell him not to?
Did you say he could be able to overtake safely there, then say you never once said it was safe to overtake there?
Do you know what "there" means?
Hi , Thanks for getting in touch
All the dash cams we do would be advertised on our website
If you can please DM me with more details however I can certainly look into this for you and see what we have in stock
Of course if you had any understanding of the Highway Code you'd know that's not the only reason it tells him not to overtake here
The words 'solid white line' is a dead giveaway
You know exactly what is on the road and makes you incorrect
Or is it a case of you never bothered looking - typical bad driver, uppity and ignorant
To safely overtake generally requires entering the next lane, except in extreme circumstances, like this section of the A303 (5 metres wide, not the usual 3
said and that I am correct
Or is it a case of you never bothered reading the comments
You lot are all the same, uppity and ignorant
If you took a look in the Highway Code yourself you might know that there are multiple reasons why it says the driver must/should not overtake here (including the solid white line, on his side, from the traffic calming to the yellow box)
So why are you arguing the cyclist should let the driver through?
Just wait and overtake safely like you were taught
You did take lessons, I hope?
