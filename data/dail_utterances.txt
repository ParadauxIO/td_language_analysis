It is good that Stormont is functional again
It is certainly historic in that it breaks the long lineage of unionist dominance for over 100 years in the northern part of Ireland
I would argue that, for the last two years, there has been a democratic veto by the DUP on spurious grounds in regard to the protocol
There are many factors relating to that protocol
As a result of that veto, working people of the North of Ireland have been greatly damaged with regard to public services
That has only been compounded by Tory austerity
We only have to look at waiting lists for the NHS in the North
Hundreds of thousands of people are waiting for ordinary medical treatment
One of the inspirational developments in the past two years has been trade unions and workers coming together, regardless of their religion, on the picket line and breaking the horrible sectarianism of the past
It just shows that when working people come together via their trade unions, strikes and their workplace, there is a potential for a different Ireland, other than a partitionist Ireland
What has happened is important
Working people are hopefully seeing a different constitutional aspiration with regard to the North of Ireland
Can it happen? Yes, it can
Working people, regardless of what their religion is and where they are living in this State, have a bond of solidarity and support regarding who we are and what our economic interests are
There are other economic interests in this State that do not have regard for economic interests of working people
That has become more profound and has been compounded by the partitionist nature of the State
The glimmer of hope is not only there in Stormont but also the power of working people, North and South
It is good news that a special committee is being set up to consider the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly on Drugs Use
That is a good development about which I have a number of questions
First, when will that committee commence and, second, how long will it go on for? If it goes on for a protracted period, it could run into the next general election and then nothing will happen
I hope the special committee will be short-lived, running for only three or four months
That would at least give the Government some time to consider its recommendations and any possible legislative changes based on those recommendations

Institutional investment funds play a major role in the rental sector and I would suggest that this has a very detrimental effect
They bought very cheap about a decade ago and now rent very high
These funds come in many forms with many names
This is a family show so I will not mention some of the names people have for them
In recent months, a plebiscite was held in Berlin with regard to property bought by these large funds
Berliners have, by popular vote, told the state government to confiscate the assets of these large corporate bodies
Is it now time to stop the influence of these corporate funds and confiscate the assets they have essentially robbed from the State?
I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time
" I am sharing time with Deputies Murphy and Boyd Barrett
I thank the Office of Parliamentary Legal Advisers, OPLA, for its assistance with this Bill
Even though it is a very short Bill, the office did a lot of work to determine its permissibility and found it legally permissible under many stipulations of law, including European law
It found that, if there was political will, this could be legislated for
That is important to note
I welcome our esteemed guests from all parts of the world to the Public Gallery
Many people here have shown great commitment on this issue
This debate has gone on for decades
In my living memory, the default position of the State has always been to continue to criminalise and incarcerate people for drug use
Whatever one believes as to the moral and ethical issues around drug use, we have had six decades of this
Ireland has one of the highest drug-related death rates in Europe
Our prisons are overflowing with addiction issues and the drug industry
We would think that after six decades of failure things would have moved on
The debate has evolved, and I include myself in this
Most people are more educated, informed and enlightened about what has gone before and what needs to happen now
As I have said previously, imprisoning, criminalising and stigmatising people does not work
We have seen that in other jurisdictions
It is important to move on
Many people are questioning the logic of our anti-drug laws
They were written in the 1970s when the war on drugs was in its full throes
If we scratch the surface, we see that the war on drugs was concentrated on racism and class with regard to poor people and people of colour
This is for another debate at another time
I am glad that public opinion has progressed and moved on
People do not have the hang-ups that others have in relation to discriminating against people
The citizens' assembly has projected that we need to move on from the  As well as the citizens' assembly making its recommendations on stopping criminalising people, 15 months ago the justice committee published a very good report which is a damning indictment of our criminal justice system and continuously criminalising people
My interpretation, and that of many others, is that it advocated a different model and approach to drug use and misuse
We all understand this
It went further on stopping criminalising people and looked at various models and jurisdictions
To get on to what the Bill is about, it is very moderate
I and my party are the first to say this
We hope it is a precursor to full regulation of cannabis
It is a moderate Bill on the simple possession of up to 7 g of cannabis for personal use
People have asked me why it is 7 g
If we look at Luxemburg and Malta they have stipulated 7 g
It is a small amount for simple possession
If this were legislated for tomorrow, somebody with that amount of cannabis would not be prosecuted and would not have to go through the criminal justice system
We would think this would make sense but sometimes sense goes out the door
The adult caution scheme was introduced in 2020
It is extremely arbitrary and at the discretion of individual gardaí regarding those they may find in possession of a small amount of drugs
Since 2020 the number of people charged and brought through the criminal justice system has exploded
It has not reduced
It has increased to more than 6,500 people being brought to court for simple possession
It is very arbitrary
Do individual gardaí use their discretion? In most cases they do not
It should not be up to an individual garda; the law on simple possession should change
This is what the Bill is about and what the citizens' assembly has made recommendations on
It is very arbitrary
People being brought before a criminal court for a small amount of drugs does not work
If somebody can tell me how it does work, I am all ears
We have been all ears for the past six decades and it does not work
A better system is decriminalisation of the person
We are remaining in the paradigm of drugs being illegal
We are not talking about making things legal in the Bill
We are talking about the decriminalisation of the person and this is important
The elephant in the room is the black market, which is very profitable
The people who control the black market are criminal gangs which are very violent
They use all sorts of intimidation in communities throughout the country
Largely they control the black market
We have this ridiculous system in place whereby drugs that supposed to be controlled by the State are controlled by the black market
Why allow this to happen? Why let this vacuum continue to exist? The Bill is very moderate
I understand the Government has tabled a timed amendment, which is very disappointing
The ink is hardly dry on the citizens' assembly's report and the Government is saying there needs to be a timed amendment on this
This is a test of the will of the Government on this issue
I am not naive; I know that members of the Government are bitterly opposed to the recommendations of the citizens' assembly
They want the  These doctors want the
I thank colleagues for their contributions
This discussion has been a little more progressive than the debate in the House 11 years ago on a similar proposal
I completely disagree with some of the views expressed
An argument that has always really annoyed me is that cannabis is a gateway to harder drugs
That is absolute rubbish
When people talk about harder drugs, they are referring to heroin
The gateway to heroin is not cannabis; it is poverty, alienation and serious trauma
We should remember that alcohol has a lot to answer for in this country
It is a legal drug
I can walk out the doors of this Chamber and straight through the doors of two bars that will serve me as much alcohol as I want
Alcohol kills four people a day in this country, which is 5% of all deaths
If we go down the road of making alcohol illegal, if we think the drug wars were bad wait until the alcohol wars come in
Wait and see, it will put the drug wars into the ha'penny place
I find it incredible that Deputy Healy Rae says that cannabis is a gateway drug
He owns a pub
Alcohol is a psychoactive substance
Most people drink in this country, but most people do not have problematic use but there are people who have problematic use with alcohol and they die
There is a terrible issue around that
I note some of the terminology the Minister of State has used about undermining the citizens' assembly and it being premature and deeming it to be disrespectful
I do not know who writes this stuff but we have been waiting for six decades for this debate
Things have moved on but I am not sure if the Government has moved on
I think that public opinion has become much more progressive regarding this issue
People are not hung up on the old tropes of stigmatisation and the rhetoric that can be used against people who use drugs
Most people who use drugs do not have problematic use
We acknowledge, however, that some people do
These people should get treatment as soon as possible
There is a huge shortage of treatment beds in this country, and when people get treatment, the outcomes are very good
Regarding the proliferation of drugs, since the 1970s, the availability of all sorts of drugs has increased
We cannot police ourselves out of a situation of the proliferation of drugs
It is just not possible
Other jurisdictions across the world have said that this is absolutely impossible
The amount of resources that goes into trying to stop drugs is largely a waste
Other jurisdictions, particularly in South America, have now said that all the resources that go into preventing drugs - not only what happens in their countries, but into Europe and the United States - simply do not work
They are looking at different models of decriminalisation and regulation
That is very important
Regarding the medical cannabis access programme, in 2019 the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 was amended in relation to those who can get access to medical cannabis
Fewer than 100 people have got access, some via licence and some via the medical cannabis access programme
The irony at the end of it in this particular issue is that some people who have got a licence for medical cannabis can have more than 7g on their person
In some cases it can be multiples of that if they are on licence for medical cannabis
They are lawfully allowed to possess cannabis if they have a prescription
However, if a person does not have prescription he or she can be prosecuted
There are huge discrepancies regarding that and the legislation we are talking about
In my life experience growing up in Clondalkin I saw the terrible dark side of addiction
I saw what happens to individuals, communities and society as a whole
There is a dark side to drugs, which we all acknowledge
However, my life experience tells me that continually criminalising people, putting people in prison and wasting vast resources in containment, jailing people and bringing people through the criminal justice system does not work
We have to look at different models as to how we can go about changing course
One of the models is decriminalisation
To be clear, I am talking about decriminalising the person rather than the drugs
That is a good model but to me it does not go far enough
There are shortcomings regarding decriminalisation even in Portugal
It is not a perfect panacea by any means; nothing is a perfect panacea, but something is better than letting people die
That is what is happening with drug-related deaths
We have to change course and to do so we need to change our mindset and we need to change our laws
If we do not change the laws, it is lip service
I have no doubt that there are elements of this Government who are happy enough with the status quo
In fact, they probably want to go more medieval than they have done before
I do not know where the members of the Green Party are today
The Green Party has quite a progressive policy on cannabis and drugs in general, but they will be voting against this Bill
They have completely sold their soul for the last four years
There are some very good people in the Green Party on a lot of issues that we have discussed in the lifetime of this Government
It is disappointing, considering the citizens' assembly recommendations
The citizens' assembly Chair has been unequivocal when he stated that there is no time to waste
We need to change course and change how people are dealt with in relation to drug use in Ireland
That means legislative change
If we do not change legislation we will be in the same room in ten years time, probably talking about the same issues and the same problems
Something has to change
Where there is a will there is a way
That is the most important thing
Many people listening to and viewing this debate might have had different opinions on this issue a number of years ago
They may have changed and some people may have changed to the opposite side and become more in favour of locking people up
However, I am of the firm view that the majority of people in this country have moved on
They want to see things change in this country with legislative change and harm reduction
In that sense, as a public representative for the last eight and a half years, I think it is disappointing to hear the same rhetoric and the same lip service being paid to this issue
I think the Government is on the wrong side of history on this issue
The Government has a chance with the special Oireachtas committee to make the changes, but the jury is out in relation to that
My question concerns the ongoing situation in the West Bank
As we have witnessed, it is not just since October 2023 that there has been an upscaling of oppression in the West Bank so I would like to hear the Tánaiste's comments on what is happening
That is welcome
There seems to be intensification of the oppression in the West Bank
Of the 358 people who have been murdered by Israelis, 100 were children
What have they done to the Israeli state? Some of the footage is unbelievable - children on streets just being shot dead
It is arbitrary
It is not just a policy of arbitrary detention, arbitrary killing and arbitrary destruction; it is about the arbitrary reoccupation of the West Bank
This is ongoing
Since October 2023, some 5,000 people have been imprisoned by the Israelis in the West Bank
People who were just going about their business were detained
A man named Anas Abu Srour, who is executive director of the Aida Youth Center in Bethlehem, visited Dublin last summer with a number of children from the centre
He was arbitrarily detained for six months as he was going about his business
I raised his detention in a parliamentary question
Hopefully, the Tánaiste can bring his case to the attention of the Israeli ambassador
I agree
Settler violence against Palestinians has intensified
This is a policy of the Israeli government to drive Palestinians from land and to use intimidation and violence against Palestinians
This is ongoing
However, there must be accountability
One of the schools mentioned by the Tánaiste, in a village called Khirbet Zanuta, was funded by Irish Aid and was completely destroyed
There must be accountability not only for settler violence but also for violence by the Israeli state
There must be sanctions
I ask the Tánaiste to consider the Control of Economic Activities (Occupied Territories) Bill
This is a very moderate Bill and I ask the Government to look again at it
There must be some sort of economic sanctions against settler violence and the Israeli state regarding the ongoing violence against Palestinians
Is there compensation that the Israelis-----

Earlier this week, the Health Research Board, HRB, published a report on the future of the medical cannabis access programme, MCAP
It is an extensive report of over 220 pages
While it addresses the limitations around medical cannabis, it endorses expanding the programme, particularly for people with nerve pain and neuropathic pain
Thus far, the MCAP has been extremely restrictive, with only 50 people prescribed medical cannabis since the scheme was set up in 2019
The majority of people who want to access the programme cannot access it
Does the Tánaiste agree the programme is very restrictive? Will he endorse its expansion to include other conditions?
Tomorrow, the Citizens' Assembly on Drugs Use will publish its final report
It will be an historic day in the context of this issue
The assembly has made 30 recommendations calling for reform of our current drug policy
It has stated that drug use and misuse is a public health issue, rather than a criminal one
Overall, the sentiment is that the Factors such as poverty, disadvantage and deep trauma that goes on in people's lives mean people turn to drugs sometimes, alcohol sometimes
These are huge social determinants on this issue
Public opinion has shifted, particularly in the last number of years, and is changing course in relation to the position over the past six decades, as I stipulated
This has been reflected not only in the citizens' assembly but also at the justice committee, which had a very good report 14 months ago on a different course of action on drug use and funding communities
I believe there is a generational chance to change the course taken over the past six decades
Ireland has one of the highest rates of overdose and drug-related deaths in Europe
In the North of Ireland there is an explosion of drug-related deaths
Something needs to happen
Other countries have done it differently, with safe consumption rooms and so forth
That needs to be done here as quickly as possible
The chairperson of the citizens' assembly stated that there is no time to waste
If it saves one life, one person, it is worth changing course regarding criminalising people
Will the Government take the recommendations of the citizens' assembly not just on policy but also on legislative change, which is key? The Misuse of Drugs Act has been in place since the 1970s, criminalising people, sending people through the criminal justice system and the courts, and jailing people
It does not work
Show me where it does work
Other jurisdictions have showed that we can change course, save lives and take people out of the criminal justice system
One of the main elements of the report was not paying lip service to our approach but changing the legislation
The Taoiseach said criminalising people for possession of small amounts of drugs, no matter what the drugs are, is simply a waste of resources for the State
Whether people use drugs or not is irrelevant
The proliferation of drugs and availability of drugs is widespread
It is impossible
People in the law enforcement area have said that law enforcement alone simply cannot curtail the availability of drugs or the reasons people take drugs
A lot of people take drugs and never have a problem but there are people who will fall into addiction
Next week, in a test for the Government, People Before Profit is bringing forward a very simple Bill providing for cases where somebody has simple possession of cannabis on their person
We are asking you to have a look at the Bill, which is very short, to endorse it and to let it go to Committee Stage
This is the test
The days of lip service are over and the days of saving lives are here
In October, the Citizens' Assembly on Drugs Use made more than 30 recommendations in respect of our drugs policy
Has the Taoiseach received that report from the chair of the assembly? If so, when will he make it public? Most importantly, what does the Government plan to do to implement those recommendations?
My question relates to the Minister's engagements and, in particular, her recent meeting with representatives of the big social media platforms
We have already seen that social media plays a significant role for the far right and how it spreads its disinformation and rhetoric
Will the Minister give us a progress report on how she got on with those social media platforms?
I thank the Minister
These platforms make a vast amount of money
A vast number of people engage in social media, the large majority of whom are responsible and do not spread hate
However, in recent years, certain agitators have used rhetoric and tones it is incredible they get away with
Social media platforms have a responsibility, for those who are viewing this stuff and for society as a whole, to close these people down
I do not watch most of that stuff but I have done so in recent times
The free rein that some of these individuals get is incredible
They agitate and spread hatred and division
If they are spreading that vile rhetoric, surely social media platforms have a responsibility to close them down
Some of these agitators are benefiting financially from the content they put up online
In fact, that is how they grow their status and following
They solicit people to fund their content, most of which is inflammatory and causes hate
This has been going on for a considerable time
I hope that during the Minister's engagement, particularly with the bigger companies, she relayed that this cannot go on
This is a threat to society
These people have a political ideology that is based on hatred and racism and they want to overthrow society
It is imperative that social media companies are held to account and that these people are also held to account
That is the most important thing here

I commend the authors of the report, in particular, the Irish Women's Parliamentary Caucus
This is a comprehensive motion and a tapestry for a framework on the nature of rights-based care and the evolution of care
At one stage in our history, people in care were institutionalised
That model obviously does not work and the community-based system in place now is better than the system we had in the past
Things have moved on but during one notch in time, the pandemic, we saw the divide in our health system between private and public healthcare
It did not really make a difference because public healthcare was at the cutting edge in trying to provide people with a way out of the pandemic
Carers play an enormous role in the fabric of life, whether paid or not
I was a carer before I entered the Dáil and when my time in here finishes, I will probably go back to care work
It is extremely rewarding
The people I met in that job and vocation taught me a huge amount, not only about themselves but also about myself and society
There are carers in all walks of life, some of whom are paid while others are not paid
It is important to acknowledge that
In the capitalist system carers can go unnoticed and unrewarded
They are not looking for financial rewards, just the basics of caring, which can be arbitrary
In particular, there is a huge lacuna around respite provision for people who need it
Carers need respite as well
There is a major divide in regard to those who can avail of respite care and those who cannot
I think the Minister of State will acknowledge that
The motion acknowledges the role of private sector workers in care work
Twenty-five years ago, 80% of nursing home provision was run by the State
It is the opposite now, with 80% of care provided by the private sector
There are major downsides to this, particularly in respect of the pay and conditions of carers
There is a serious issue with recruiting carers and a serious shortage of staff
The reason for this is generally down to pay and conditions
That must be acknowledged
The motion does not refer to the care and repair scheme, which is a brilliant service
The Government should be a bit more vocal in letting people know that they may be able to avail of it
I have seen how well the scheme works in practice but it goes under the radar when it comes to care provision
It is a very holistic and community-based type of care
There is not just the care aspect; there is also the repair
The scheme focuses on the kinds of community and human bonds that are extremely important in respect of care
Care evolves into many categories, as I have said
Focusing on human relationships is a very important part of care work
There are huge deficits in the provision of care and in terms of who can avail of it
At one point or another in our lives, we all may need care or may provide care
There is a rich tapestry when it comes to how care works
There are a lot of deficits and divides between those who can avail of care and those who cannot
If there is one thing we can do as a caring society, it is to move towards a rights-based model that is focused on the UNCRPD, which is extremely important
People need rights and they need a say in how they are cared for
That is very important as we go forward
My question relates to Irish citizens in Gaza
I compiled the question two or three weeks ago
The Tánaiste had to reschedule this session
Irish citizens are still in Gaza
There was really good news about Emily Hand, the Irish-Israeli girl who was released
I would like to hear the Tánaiste's thoughts on resolving the issue of Irish citizens who are still in Gaza
I commend the officials, especially those in the Irish embassy in Cairo, who have done a huge amount of work on this
There was a glimmer of hope and humanity at the weekend when Emily Hand was released
Children have paid a terrible price in the past eight weeks, regardless of their nationality
My heart sinks to see any child kidnapped or murdered
A terrible thing is happening
Irish citizens are still in Gaza, in particular Zak Hania
My understanding is that he is not allowed to leave because the Israeli state will not allow him to leave
There is a temporary ceasefire, but it is only temporary
The Israeli state wants to continue its murderous campaign which affects, not only Irish citizens in Gaza, but the whole people of Gaza
Those who escaped Gaza in recent weeks also have relatives in Gaza
My understanding from the Irish citizens who have escaped Gaza is that the Irish embassy and the Department of Foreign Affairs are actively trying to reunite them with some of their relatives, especially those in dire situations
That would be very welcome
The reaction at the weekend of the Tánaiste's counterpart in Israel, Eli Cohen, to the Taoiseach's tweet was bizarre in how he distorted what the Taoiseach said
The Irish ambassador to Israel was reprimanded
In the past eight weeks, has the Government reprimanded the Israeli ambassador to Ireland for some of the absolutely bizarre things she and her officials have put on social media?
But has the Government reprimanded the Israeli ambassador?

I wish to raise an issue I have raised numerous times over the past two years and one I think my colleagues in Dublin Mid-West have also raised
It is the lack of public health nurses in Dublin Mid-West, which is the area I am from
This is particularly acute in Newcastle, Lucan and Clondalkin
As the Minister of State can imagine, public health nurses are vitally important for developmental checks on infants
It is vitally important that parents have the reassurance of those checks
However, for several years, that has not been evident with regard to mothers, infants and babies getting those checks
From when a child is born to when that child is four years old, there should generally be four checks, but that is not happening
The last response I got from the HSE was that there is a recruitment situation
The last response to a parliamentary question I got was probably about two or three months ago and it stated that, thus far, it has not been successful
The recruitment ban on HSE front-line staff has obviously compounded this issue
We have an unacceptable situation where mothers and parents do not have access to this vital service
As most people know, these services are extremely important to assessment of a child’s development
If you do not have them, things will be missed, and intervention is absolutely key
I hope the Minister of State has better news than other Ministers had in previous engagements on this
Parents have been on to us
They are telling us that because of the area they are in, they do not have access to this particular service
If somebody lives in a different area of Dublin or a different part of Ireland, they have access to that, so why are they being denied that important access? I understand there are recruitment pressures
However, that does not justify people being denied these services for their children
I hope the Minister of State has good news for the parents who have been asking these important questions about a vital service
That is extremely disappointing, to say the least
It does not really say anything at all
I do not know what to say to that
All I can say is that the recruitment freeze is obviously compounding the issue
The Minister of State might be able to answer the following question
Is the recruitment freeze having an impact on the recruitment of public health nurses, especially in the CHO 7 area? I hope she can answer that
My understanding is that 40% of all posts in the Dublin Mid-West region are vacant
That is a huge issue
Is the issue around the public health nursing sponsorship programme? Has anybody been recruited via that programme? One of the issues that is having a detrimental effect on recruiting nursing staff in this area is the cost of living, particularly around Dublin where nurses cannot even get a place to rent
Is the Government thinking about special premiums or incentives for jobs providing a vital service such as public health nurses to attract graduates? We have an amazing cohort of graduates from this country who are well educated and enthusiastic about their job
They are finding a huge impediment getting a place to live in the areas we are talking about
This is having a knock-on effect not only in Dublin Mid-West but across the board
If the Minister of State can answer those questions, I can bring this back to some of the parents and explain the latest situation in what they are looking for regarding their children

However, for several years, that has not been evident with regard to mothers, infants and babies getting those checks
From when a child is born to when that child is four years old, there should generally be four checks, but that is not happening
The last response I got from the HSE was that there is a recruitment situation
The last response to a parliamentary question I got was probably about two or three months ago and it stated that, thus far, it has not been successful
The recruitment ban on HSE front-line staff has obviously compounded this issue
We have an unacceptable situation where mothers and parents do not have access to this vital service
As most people know, these services are extremely important to assessment of a child’s development
If you do not have them, things will be missed, and intervention is absolutely key
I hope the Minister of State has better news than other Ministers had in previous engagements on this
Parents have been on to us
They are telling us that because of the area they are in, they do not have access to this particular service
If somebody lives in a different area of Dublin or a different part of Ireland, they have access to that, so why are they being denied that important access? I understand there are recruitment pressures
However, that does not justify people being denied these services for their children
I hope the Minister of State has good news for the parents who have been asking these important questions about a vital service
That is extremely disappointing, to say the least
It does not really say anything at all
I do not know what to say to that
All I can say is that the recruitment freeze is obviously compounding the issue
The Minister of State might be able to answer the following question
Is the recruitment freeze having an impact on the recruitment of public health nurses, especially in the CHO 7 area? I hope she can answer that
My understanding is that 40% of all posts in the Dublin Mid-West region are vacant
That is a huge issue
Is the issue around the public health nursing sponsorship programme? Has anybody been recruited via that programme? One of the issues that is having a detrimental effect on recruiting nursing staff in this area is the cost of living, particularly around Dublin where nurses cannot even get a place to rent
Is the Government thinking about special premiums or incentives for jobs providing a vital service such as public health nurses to attract graduates? We have an amazing cohort of graduates from this country who are well educated and enthusiastic about their job
They are finding a huge impediment getting a place to live in the areas we are talking about
This is having a knock-on effect not only in Dublin Mid-West but across the board
If the Minister of State can answer those questions, I can bring this back to some of the parents and explain the latest situation in what they are looking for regarding their children
My thoughts, solidarity and support are with the families of the children who were terribly blighted and injured on Thursday
Those brave people who intervened, the ordinary decent Dubliners, whether from Dublin or from around the world, are the heroes, as are the emergency responders
There is an element who for a long time have been fomenting hatred and poison and who hijacked the events on Thursday
These fascist agitators have been doing this for a considerable time
Their vitriol and commentary are utterly poisonous
Some of the commentary calls for migrants to be killed on the streets, and because of that, and I am sure we have all felt it, people of colour and migrants who have been living in this country for a long time are now fearful for their well-being
That cannot be tolerated under any circumstances
Social media has a lot to be challenged for in giving these people so much oxygen
It is incredible
They are calling for people to be killed and to be rounded up and so forth, and social media companies, which make vast profits and are not too far from this House, have a lot to answer for
These people feel emboldened because they can go from burning buses to burning people
I am sorry to say that because these people, and they are a small number of people, feel so emboldened as to use serious violence against other people
It is a warning not only from history but from last Thursday that these people have to be challenged
Millions of people across the world have taken to the streets in cities to show their solidarity and absolute horror at what has gone on in the last six weeks in Gaza
Last Saturday, more than 50,000 people went on the streets in Dublin and Belfast to show their solidarity
A whole cohort of people are becoming politicised by what is going on in Gaza
Not only do they see the hypocrisy of the Western powers but also the hypocrisy of the Israeli state
They see that their governments are complicit in their silence when it comes to condemnation of the Israeli state
That is not only now but also in the past
The only comparison I can make in my lifetime was 2003, when millions upon millions of people came out in solidarity with people of Iraq because of what would be subjected on them
We saw 1 million people killed by the American military machine
To those who somehow believe Israel was the beacon of democracy in the sea of despots, I ask what democracy subjects the people of Palestine to 70 years of apartheid? What democracy kills 14,000 in the space of six weeks? What democracy kills 5,000 children? Is there any question? What democracy does that? Israel has to be held to account for its war crimes
We have said many times Israel must be held to account, whether economically, diplomatically or militarily
Last night, I spoke about the deal that we have with the Defence Forces
It has bought €6 million of Israeli defence equipment
The Tánaiste got kind of tied up about why we should not stop that
Ireland should stop that immediately and Ireland should support the BDS campaign
The boycott and the isolation of Israel has to be re-energised
It was done to apartheid South Africa in the 1980s, so why can it not be done now? Across the world, workers have collectively taken action against the terrible crimes of Israel
In Belgium, port workers have refused to handle Israeli goods
Imagine the kind of knock-on effects across the world, individually and collectively by trade unions refusing to handle Israeli goods? Because it seems that the governments of this country and others will do nothing whatsoever
It is business as usual
Can the Tánaiste tell me that after everything that has happened in the past six weeks, it is business as usual? Come on
He knows it is not
We cannot treat Israel like a normal state
It is not a normal state
It subjects the Palestinian people to apartheid and it is a state of racism
The only way the State of Israel survives is the perpetual oppression of the Palestinian people and the perpetual sense of violence and brutality against them
The Palestinian people have a right to defend themselves and to challenge and resist occupation
We will always stand with the Palestinian people
It is so important that Ireland has a huge empathy and solidarity with the people of Palestine and with all oppressed people across the world
We must stand up for the people of Palestine
We have to show moral courage and principle
What is being done to the people is absolutely wrong and we must hold Israel to account
The hostages
I have a short question for the Taoiseach
Will the Government lift the recruitment embargo on front-line workers in the HSE?This is obviously having a hugely detrimental effect on our public health system
Is there a vision to lift this embargo? It is having a terrible effect on day-to-day services that we all rely on
I thank Sinn Féin for tabling the motion
We are all feeling a bit of shock at the recruitment embargo in the health service
Rather than going into a state of contraction in respect of recruitment and need, we should be expanding, and anybody would agree with that
The embargo is going to have a detrimental effect on our health services, and those fault lines between private and public, which were especially visible during Covid, will be exacerbated because of the historical inequalities in our health system
As an example, in Dublin Mid-West, mothers are finding themselves in a ludicrous situation whereby, over recent years, there has not been access to public health nurses, especially in Lucan and Newcastle, both of which are expanding areas in the context of the services they need
Likewise, there are no public health nurses for small children
It rings alarm bells straightaway if a child does not have access to a developmental nurse for their healthcare
That has been going on for the past couple of years and, obviously, the embargo is going to prevent that from improving
That is extremely worrying
There is a huge deficit in the healthcare system, and now it needs a bailout
It is not in great shape
I come from the point of view of saying we need to look at the positives of our healthcare system
There are a huge number of positives, but there are also a huge number of deficits
They are real; they are not made up by the Opposition, by any means
They are historical, whereby people who need access to healthcare cannot get it because they do not have private health insurance
It is ludicrous that 50% of the population rely on private health insurance
That is not a sustainable model for healthcare, not to mention universal healthcare, which Sláintecare is striving for
It is a good model, but we are a long distance from having a system for providing universal healthcare
The recruitment embargo is deeply upsetting and troubling and will without doubt have a knock-on effect on professionals both in the health service and those who want to come into it
When they see that Ireland is not currently employing certain professions, that could have a knock-on effect and they will not come to our health service, which we need them to do
Ireland’s healthcare system, like that in most countries, is very multicultural
All medical professions virtually everywhere in the world - Ireland is no different - are very multicultural, with a huge number of nationalities and motivated people who want to do their best for their fellow human beings
The embargo is a retrograde step for our overall healthcare system, which we want to be one with greater equality than inequality
It is a significant step backwards, and I hope it can be addressed soon
Given the murderous assault by the Israel Defense Forces does the Tánaiste's Department intend to continue to purchase goods from Israel whether they are for defensive reasons or for dual purpose reasons? As the Tánaiste will have seen, Israel is not a normal state
Israel runs on the basis of perpetual violence and oppression
How can any state call itself a democracy while doing trade with a state that has killed more than 5,500 children?
Why would the Tánaiste's Department have any sort of trade agreement with the state of Israel? In the last five years, the Tánaiste's Department has procured more than €6 million of Israeli defence equipment
Some of that is for dual use
Will the Tánaiste tell me - or give me a kind of an answer - as to why in the name of hell would this country want to do any sort of trade with the state of Israel? Over the past nine years the EU has exported €4 billion worth of armaments to Israel
These armaments are to kill and oppress Palestinians
Why would this State have any sort of dealings with a state that has killed some 5,500 children in the last six weeks? It is obnoxious
How can the Tánaiste stand over any trade deal with the state of Israel after it has done that?
There should be-----
That is gobbledygook
Ireland needs to take a moral and principled stand against the state of Israel
In the past five years Ireland has spent €6 million procuring Israeli goods and services
Surely the Tánaiste is not saying that given what Israel has done in the past in the last six weeks - and continues to do - that somehow this is business as usual
Surely the Tánaiste does not believe that
Israel is not a normal state
The Tánaiste knows that
We cannot have any sort of trade agreement with a state that continuously oppresses a people and has an almost genocidal policy against the people of Palestine
This is not a normal country and surely in these circumstances we cannot trade with the state of Israel
I did not
I do not disbelieve that

At the weekend, almost 50 people overdosed on contaminated heroin
Traces of synthetic opioid were found in samples of the heroin they took
Thankfully, no one has died as a result of the overdoses because of interventions made using a drug called naloxone, which is welcome
There are issues with naloxone, which is a prescribed drug
Experts in the field say it should be more available in the context of treating overdoses
There is another worrying trend, which the House and society should be made aware of
There could be supply issues relating to heroin coming from Afghanistan
If that is the case - it has been seen in the United States - synthetic opioids will replace heroin and that will lead to hundreds of people dying
What is the State doing as regards overdoses, the issues relating to heroin coming out of Afghanistan and the possibility of opioids engulfing Ireland as a result?
I have to attend the health committee
It is not going to be possible
I have to attend the health committee
It is not going to be possible
My question is about the waiting time for scoliosis surgery
The Scoliosis Advocacy Network has stated that more than 310 children are waiting for surgery at this time
That is completely unacceptable
I would like to hear the Minister's thoughts on the matter
That is positive but there are families with children who have been waiting for well over four months
That is completely unacceptable
The Minister's predecessor said six years ago that no child would wait more than four months
That promise has been broken many times
The Minister will understand that it is frustrating for people who have a child waiting for surgery that could be revolutionary for the child when that surgery does not happen
What the Minister said was all positive but the litmus test for families is the intervention and waiting times before their children can get surgery
It is clearly not happening quickly enough
Will the Minister reassure the families in question that surgery will happen as soon as possible?
I understand that the review by Mr
Nayagam is ongoing and that it is looking at the broad spectrum of ways to improve services
Is one of those - I am sure the Department has looked at this - for children to travel abroad for intervention or surgery? That can be slightly complicated given the nature of this surgery
Has it been actively looked at? It is good that we have more capacity but the test is whether children are waiting longer than they should for intervention, and they are
The Minister and his colleagues want to reduce the waiting time to as close as possible to the four-month target but that target is clearly being missed
As I said, 90 children have been waiting more than four months
This surgery is complicated
Has the possibility of children travelling abroad been looked at or have medical facilities where the surgery could take place been considered, other than the main hospitals in Temple Street, Crumlin and Cappagh?

Gaza has been termed "a graveyard for children"
More than 4,000 small children have been murdered by Israel, and across the world people are protesting against this savagery
We need a debate in this House to reflect the opinion on this not only in Ireland but across the world
That should reflect the untenability of the Israeli ambassador's position in Dublin
Her situation is untenable
She needs to be expelled
War crimes are being committed at the moment and people are needlessly dying, yet we have an ambassador here representing the Zionist regime that stands over murder
We need to have a debate about the terrible situation that is going on in Gaza
He should be expelled
They may be dead
That is rubbish
There has been an alarming increase in road fatalities
Compared with the figures in 2019, there are now 50% more fatalities, which is staggering because in Ireland we had a good campaign of awareness around road deaths
The figure had been going down significantly over the previous ten to 15 years, but that is not the case now
Obviously, there is a range of factors contributing to why this is happening
As one of the busiest bank holiday weekends of the year approaches, we hope that everybody who travels throughout the country on bicycles or on public transport will come back safely
However, there is a chance somebody will not
Hopefully that does not happen but the trend at this time is that people are dying on our roads every week
A campaign would be warranted in relation to road safety awareness
We all remember the very hard hitting-advertising about speeding
The advertisements were emotive, but they got the message across to motorists, pedestrians and cyclists that people can die through reckless behaviour
We need to look at more advertising and more awareness
That should apply to everybody who uses the road
I will talk about cyclists and pedestrians
I do not use a car
I cycle in here most of the time
Things have improved over the last number of years but it is still risky to cycle in the city centre
Infrastructure has been put in place but it could be much better
Over 30% of those who die on the roads are pedestrians and cyclists
It is incredible that such a figure exists
It needs to be looked at
Why is that happening? Each case is probably different but we need to bring the figure down significantly because in some situations people are just walking and are hit by a car, badly injured or sometimes killed
We have to find the reason that is happening
The fact is that the figure is at a 15-year high
There should be a cycling etiquette
Some cyclists do not adhere to the rules of the road at all
I will not mention who they are
However, some of their behaviour is quite reckless
If a cyclist hits a car, the cyclist will come off worse than the motorist
It is important that cyclists are aware of their own situation in relation to their safety
The city centre, and the spokes coming out of the city centre, are getting better when it comes to cycling infrastructure
Segregated cycling lanes are important to take cyclists away from traffic
There are bottlenecks in the city centre that are extremely dangerous
One takes one's life in one's hands when cycling in certain parts of Dublin
There should be a campaign in regard to cycling safety and pedestrian safety to urge everybody to respect each other on the roads
There are more cars than ever on our roads, more pedestrians and more cyclists
It is great that people are cycling to work
Agriculture House has hundreds of bicycles outside
People are cycling to work but they want to feel safe
Putting in the infrastructure and having public transport alternatives to the car is important
The main thing is that we respect each other
There is a huge issue around campaigning about safety for everybody, regardless of what mode of transport they use on our roads
There has been much frustration about the lack of progress with the medical cannabis access programme, MCAP
The first time the access programme was mooted was in 2017 after a report by the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA
In the meantime, there has been a lack of progress
Since 2016 and 2017, there has been much campaigning by families and individuals to get access
The majority of people who campaigned have got access via a licence system
That is not perfect by any means but at least they have access
The whole idea of the medical cannabis access programme was to give individuals access via prescription
To date, only 50 people have got access
That is a tiny number when you consider that the programme has been up and running for two years
From the outset, we have always said that the programme was extremely restrictive with the conditions that were stipulated
There is significant evidence, particularly regarding neuropathic pain, that medical cannabis can be very beneficial
The programme has been reviewed by the Health Research Board
There is hope among those who have been campaigning for this for a long time that the review will support and recommend the expansion of the programme
If it does not expand to other conditions, it is redundant
There are major issues regarding who can prescribe medical cannabis
The programme is a good concept but it is extremely onerous on the consultants who register their patients for it
Consultants say that there is significant paperwork to register patients and for access
The main thing we are requesting for those who have been campaigning for better access is an expansion of the programme
It should be general practitioner-led rather than consultant-led because consultants, at the best of times, are hard to see in the first place
That restrictive process needs to be looked at
Another issue with lack of access is where people have to go to the black market
It is onerous when people who have an illness must rely on the black market
Some people even go abroad to get access to medical cannabis
The worst of all is when people have to go without
That is just not acceptable
This programme was set up to give people access
At the moment, however, the programme is too restrictive
Hopefully, the review will support and recommend the expansion of the programme in order that people, particularly those with neuropathic pain and chronic pain, can get access
Otherwise, the programme will stand still and will be largely redundant if it does not expand in the context of the three conditions that are stipulated
The Minister of State can understand why people are frustrated
The programme has been up and running for two years and fewer than 50 people have got it via prescription
This review is going on forever
It was first mooted a year and a half ago
My most recent correspondence with the Health Research Board indicated that this is an ongoing review and will be finished by the end of the year
The Minister of State can see the frustration and what people are feeling
I am not sure if the Minister of State will be able to comment on the other issue, which is those who get it via licence
Not all those who have it via licence are reimbursed
In fact, there is a cohort of people in a ridiculous situation
Those who have it via licence cannot be reimbursed but the same product is on the MCAP register
Because the programme is so restrictive, however, the same people who can get it via licence cannot get onto the programme and then have to pay out of their own pockets
It needs to be reviewed
The concept is good but the programme needs to be expanded
If that does not happen, I cannot see a future for it
We will have the same situation whereby people who could benefit greatly from an intervention of medical cannabis will go without or have to go to the black market, and that is not acceptable
Many people have been following this, especially those who might benefit from it, and they are very frustrated by the lack of progress
Hopefully, the review will support the programme's expansion

Over the weekend, the Citizens' Assembly on Drugs Use completed its work after six months
The clear message from the citizens' assembly is to end the
Decriminalisation
It is
So do I
The Citizens' Assembly on Drugs Use will meet for the final time this weekend
It has been going on for the last six months and was a much-needed debate
All indications from the assembly will point to a different approach
We have had an approach that has failed for the last six decades
Indications from the assembly are that they will call for decriminalisation and possibly regulation, which I fully support and others will support as well
We have had six decades of criminalising people and it simply has not worked
If the recommendations from the assembly are for a radical approach, what will the Government do?
I acknowledge the really good work all our healthcare workers do on the front line of the health service
We rely on them so much for our care and everybody else's care
I am very critical of the inequalities in our health system but, as I have said many times, once people get into the public system, it is a very good system
They are treated very well and their experience is the best it can be in that environment
That is something of which this country can be very proud
However, there are historical inequalities in accessing that care, with waiting lists and so on
The job of successive Governments has been to address that but there remain gross inequalities in access
The funding shortfalls in the budget will have consequences for those who rely on services
The embargo on the recruitment of certain professions will have consequences across the board
I will focus on one issue in the budget
I spoke to the Minister informally about this serious matter, on which I hope he can throw some light
It relates to access to life-saving medicines
There is normally a budget for these medications and treatments but for next year, that budget has, in effect, been cancelled
Many patients rely on certain medications and treatments
There are 1,000 cancer patients who may not get access to 23 new medicines
Will the Minister provide clarification in this regard? Being able to get treatment is a life-and-death issue
Like all other Deputies, I received an email concerning one of these patients, who was told there would not be access to the new drug and it would require leaving the jurisdiction to access it
That is not good enough
People are reliant on these drugs as part of their medical intervention
Even Bernard Gloster has said there will be a significant slowdown as a result of the lack of additional funding for clinical programmes
This is quite serious, to say the least
I would be grateful if the Minister could offer some clarity on the funding shortfalls, particularly for new drugs and treatments
There are more than 1,000 people waiting for these new drugs and treatments; in fact, there are 4,000-plus
I hope he can provide clarity in this regard
There is huge concern about a cohort of patients who rely on new drugs and treatments
Bizarrely, in this year's budget the funding for these treatments has been taken away
This will affect thousands of patients
Like all Deputies, I received an email about a person who relies on a particular drug and has been told by their doctor that they will not get it
The person will have to leave the jurisdiction
This is a case of life and death
There are consequences for many people
This is bizarre
The country is awash with money, yet people have to go without
Will the Taoiseach give clarity on access to new drugs?

The only thing that brings about peace is a political settlement - a settlement that means people can coexist regardless of their creed
That coexistence cannot exist under a system of oppression and occupation
In fact, it is an affront to the concept
Nobody wants to see anybody die, regardless of whether they are Jewish, Muslim, Christian or of no religion at all, but decades of brutal oppression and of the international community overlooking Israeli impunity and apartheid have led us to this situation
What does it take to conclude that Israel is not a normal state? Its very existence sees it exist in perpetual conflict that inflicts further barbarity on the Palestinian people
Over the past ten days, Israel has murdered 4,000 people in the Gaza Strip, including 1,000 children
As legislators and members of the public, we can send our solidarity to the Palestinian people, call an end to the siege, expel the Israeli ambassador, which other countries have done, and call out the crimes of the Israeli state
I too welcome the O'Farrell family
We have spoken about Shane many times over the last seven or eight years
One does not have to have a forensic mind to understand that Shane O'Farrell should have been alive today
We should not even be speaking about him but because of systematic failures in all strands of the authorities, Shane is dead and we cannot bring him back
There is one thing that we can do, as legislators and friends of Shane and the O'Farrell family, and that is to bring justice and some solace to the family after 12 years of absolute hurt
The scoping exercise did not bring any answers
In fact, it raised more questions than answers
An exercise such as that, which went on for so long, has led to more questions about that fateful night
If a man who had breached his bail conditions so many times had been imprisoned or had his liberty taken away on any of those occasions, this incident would never have happened
That begs the question as to why he was allowed to breach his bail conditions on so many occasions while the authorities allowed him to go free
On the night in question, Shane had the liberty to cycle and exercise, as most of us do, but the man who killed him that night should not have been at liberty
As a result of the authorities failing Shane and his family, Shane is dead
The least the Minister can do is call for a public inquiry
That is the least she can do
I think there is a consensus among all Deputies, Opposition and Government, in calling for a public inquiry
A public inquiry will give the family some sort of solace and answers about the independence of the scoping exercise
Anything less is doing an absolute injustice to the O'Farrell family
The people of Gaza are paying an absolutely terrible price for the crimes of Israel
Already 300 children have been killed by bombs by the Israeli state
These are tantamount to war crimes
Cutting off electricity, with no medical supplies and no food, to 2 million people is tantamount to a war crime
What has happened over the past week would sicken anybody in this House
Nobody wants to see anybody die
Will the Tánaiste use his influence as the Minister for Foreign Affairs for this country, at EU level, to hold Israel to account for its continued war crimes against the Palestinian people?
It is very obvious that we should not be in this position
It should not have come to this
These workers provide a vital service in our community, yet they have to potentially go on strike on Tuesday
That is embarrassing
There is no disrespect to the Minister and to the Minister of State personally, but it is embarrassing
This country is awash with money and for the money they are looking for and for pay parity relative to their colleagues, it is embarrassing
Hopefully, the Government will address this issue and pay these workers what they deserve
For example, Deputies are paid very well but we could not a situation where one Deputy was paid less than others
We would be the first ones to give out and we are paid very well, yet we have health service workers are in this situation
That is completely unacceptable
Section 39 workers - I was at one stage - are paid 10% less than their colleagues so they have lesser terms and conditions
It is just not acceptable
We can have all the platitudes we want but we need to address this issue to prevent a strike
The only thing that will prevent a strike is if the workers are finally acknowledged and paid what they deserve
This has been going on for far too long at 13 years and more
This is a legacy from the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, years, and austerity that has left a bitter taste with a lot of workers such as teachers, nurses and section 56 and section 39 workers
This is a legacy issue and a throwback but it needs to be resolved very quickly
I can never understand why these artificial tiers are put in place regarding people's pay, especially in the public sector
I just do not get it
Why would we want to pay somebody 20% or 10% less than another person who is doing the exact same job? Who would make that kind of stuff up? Maybe this can happen in the private sector where it is a race to the bottom and people are trying to profiteer
We are talking about public sector workers generally who do work the vast majority of people will not do; let us be honest
It is a really important job but we pay them less
It is absolutely ridiculous
Hopefully, this can be resolved so that workers do not have to go out on strike on Tuesday
I am sure it is the last place they want to be
They want to do their vital jobs but if they need to go out on strike, they will get all of our support and our solidarity
They will get a huge amount of public support as the public is on their side
They know an injustice when they see it
I hope the Minister and Minister of State will do the right thing and pay these workers what they deserve
What future does the community safety innovation fund have? I understand it is in its infancy but could the Minister lay out its future over the next two to three years?
It is very welcome that there is extra funding for this initiative
My only criticism is that it is not targeted as it should be
In areas which have been subjected to criminal activity by these gangs, one will find areas of deprivation where this manifests itself
The funding should be a bit more targeted with respect to these particular areas
It is welcome, however
It raises the question of why these initiatives and projects are not funded directly by central government rather than by the proceeds of crime
I ask the Minister of Justice to comment on this particular question
A somewhat bigger question, which I am unsure if the Minister will be able to answer, is how to undercut criminal gangs in this country
Such gangs are largely profiteering and generating money through the drug industry
That is essentially what they are doing
Robbing banks is yesterday's kind of activity for criminal gangs
These gangs generate enormous amounts of money through the drugs industry
It is ironic that we have legislation in this State called the Misuse of Drugs Act
The drugs these gangs deal in are essentially controlled drugs but we do not have any control at all
These are controlled drugs and are essentially controlled by criminal gangs
We need to have a long discussion - this is obviously going through the Citizens' Assembly on Drugs Use at the moment - on how to undercut the drug industry with a view to regulating certain drugs and diverting any revenues which are generated away from the black market into a regulated system
Otherwise, we will have a perpetual cycle of criminality
Generally, this market is generated and run for the profits of drugs
We cannot get away from that and we need to undercut it

I am going to concentrate my time on all matters relating to health
The budget in regard to health has been very low key and quite bland
Normally, in my experience of budgets in these Houses, health budgets have been headline news regarding the level of provision and so forth, but this budget has not delivered on anything in the form of proposals relating, in particular, to Sláintecare
In regard to capacity, any mention of the 1,500 beds the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, signalled for acute services is completely absent
There will continue to be these unacceptable delays in waiting times and insufficient capacity in our public health system
The country is awash with money, yet the health budget has basically stood still, which is just not acceptable
This is the case with regard to mental health in particular
Spending on mental health accounts for €1
1 billion, less than 5
5% of the overall budget
The recommended level of spending in most countries on mental health is 10%, so there is a huge deficit, which has a knock-on effect
It means people will go without and not get the intervention they need, and that will have very significant consequences, far beyond the realm of Leinster House
One issue shows that the devil is in the detail
I got an email yesterday from a woman, who does not live in the constituency I represent, regarding funding that normally comes through the health budget for new treatments and drugs
I spoke informally to the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, about this yesterday
Normally, there are tens of millions of euro for new treatments and new drugs from pharmaceutical companies but this year, there is zero
There is no money for new treatments or drugs
That will have enormous consequences for that person and she is not in isolation
She is only one person
I am sure there are hundreds of people relying on new treatments and new drugs for illnesses they have
This is a serious and retrograde step for our health system
As I have said, as a consequence people will have to go without
In fact, this lady's doctor told her that she will have to leave the jurisdiction if she wants to get these particular medications
For the sake of €20 million to pay for treatments that will help hundreds of people, the Government is telling them they cannot get it and have to leave the country
This is a complete joke
I do not know who has made this decision, but hopefully they will reflect and funding will be put in place for new medications
Overall, it has been a bland budget
It is a continuance of divided health services with inequalities within them
People have to wait and there are capacity issues
Again, this is an opportunity missed
Over the weekend, the Citizens' Assembly on Drug Use met for the penultimate time
All indications from the assembly point to a liberalisation of our drugs policy
We have had six decades of this and it has been largely a failure
If the recommendations are for decriminalisation and forms of regulation, will the Government implement those recommendations? According to the chair, Mr
Paul Reid, there is a "mood for change"
Is there a mood for change in relation to six decades of a failed policy around drug use?
Whoever thought that lifting the eviction ban was a good idea needs to reflect
In this case it was the Government
Since the eviction ban was lifted hundreds of families have moved into emergency accommodation
This is a fact
They should not be in this situation, which the Government has created for thousands of families
This stems back to the policy of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil to have a market-led approach rather than a citizen-led approach
Other countries, in particular Austria, have a much better system of public housing that does not look to the market
The Government speaks on this issue day in, day out and year in, year out and the situation gets worse
In recent months 15 to 20 families have come to my office to speak about the heartache and trauma of a notice to quit
Perhaps five or ten years ago these families could have gone back into the rental market but that is not the case now
The majority of these families will go into emergency accommodation
This is a fact
The Government has allowed this to happen and it continues to allow it to happen
The trauma and stress that comes with this is incalculable
We cannot put words on this situation whereby families who had rental accommodation do not know where they will go
The stress this puts on children is unbelievable
When families go into emergency accommodation they could be stuck there for a hell of a long time because there is a lottery to get rental accommodation
Ordinary housing assistance payment rates make it virtually impossible to get any accommodation
With homeless housing assistance payment rates, people are chasing the market because it is so inflationary
The situation is the perfect storm for those families and individuals who find themselves in homeless accommodation
The real homeless figures are probably beyond 20,000 and they will probably get worse
If we track the situation that has happened in recent months, we see it will only get worse because of the policy on the eviction ban
It would make sense in an emergency accommodation crisis, such as that which we have in the State, that until this emergency is lifted an eviction ban would be put in place for the foreseeable future with regard to landlords evicting tenants in the case of selling a property
These are all political choices the Minister of State's party, along with other parties, have made on this
It will only get worse and there is a consequence
We can talk about political consequences but the most important consequence is for the families who find themselves in this situation, which is not of their making but of the Minister of State’s party and his Government
It is as simple as that and the Minister of State will have to wrestle with his conscience that they have put thousands and thousands of people in emergency accommodation and the consequences of that are incalculable
This has been a very sorry episode, to say the least
We talk about trust and confidence in our health service, and when families have been let down fundamentally, it can leave a terrible taste in people's mouths
Families should never be in this situation
There are families with children in complicated situations who need that intervention as soon as possible, and because of the fallout of this, that wait is going to be longer
That is the difficult for those families to accept
They know they have children who need an intervention as soon as possible, and now all surgery seems to be suspended
When you do not have trust, you do not have anything
If the reviews do anything, they have to rectify the mistakes that have been made in the past number of years and probably beyond that
I am no medical expert, but surely lines were crossed around clinical governance and criteria
There is no doubt about that
I am a member of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and two years ago, a number of surgeons appeared before the committee in relation to this issue
It was one of the best committee meetings I have ever been at
It was extremely positive, and the people who spoke, spoke very passionately about the situation they find their patients in
I think families drew confidence from that and from the assurances of previous Ministers that the situation was going to be resolved once and for all
Now, families find themselves going backwards rather than forward
That children are being let down is probably the cruellest thing of all
I will have a question for the Minister later on
If surgery has been suspended, and I know Bernard Gloster has said that is not the case, families will have to wait years upon years for this intervention
Surely, we have got to look at different ways of intervening
I know it is quite complicated, but can specialists be brought from different countries to Ireland as a temporary measure? Again, I know it is complicated, but can children get surgery outside the State? I think we might have to look at those options
I know there are complications in relation to children travelling, but we may have to look at that
It is not perfect by any means, but families want the intervention as soon as possible
In relation to the reviews, it is extremely important that the families and advocacy groups have their say on how this has all played out
What has happened, particularly around clinical governance, is completely unsatisfactory
We need to learn the deep lessons from the mistakes of the past, and hopefully not the future
People Before Profit welcomes this legislation but it is beyond me why it has taken so long to bring it to this juncture
Why do we have to put legislation forward to compel energy companies to give money back? In the last number of years, and well beyond, the companies have been seriously profiteering from the energy crisis
People's bills have borne this out
Ordinary people are struggling with huge energy bills that are completely out of sync in relation to their income
People are really struggling
They must make a choice and may have no alternative between heating their home or eating
In the past years many people have been left with that kind of choice while we also have the immoral situation of energy companies making vast amounts of money on people's misery
How was this allowed to happen? On what grounds was this allowed to happen is open for debate
Over the past decades the liberalisation and the deregulation of energy in Ireland has not worked
Energy costs 25 years ago in relation to bills were actually much cheaper in Ireland than in any other European country
There was no competition: the ESB was the monolith and it was a very good company
Now we have regulation and we have competition
Has it brought more efficiency? No it has not
Has it brought prices down? No, it is doing the opposite
Now we have a situation where a number of companies have made absolutely vast amounts of money and particularly in the last number of years
Windfall taxes in their complexity are probably a once-off measure
They do not look retrospectively at the vast amounts of money these companies have made
This is where it draws its weakness
We must look at the details around how much money can be expelled from a windfall tax
I am sure these companies now have their accountants ready to go to see how they can get out of some of the loopholes around paying this tax
One of the other substantial aspects we need to talk about is how energy companies are planned in this country
Ideologically I believe that public services such as energy should be nationalised
There should be no competition and they should be there for the public good
They should look at the situation around renewables, being completely environmentally friendly, and also being accessible to the public
Now, however, we have the opposite of that
The bigger question here is around the nationalisation of energy companies
In other countries we can see a different model rather than the capitalist model of competition all the time
A model of nationalisation is a better and more efficient system than what we have at the moment
The Bill is welcome but it is very late in the day
Again, the devil is in the detail and how much money we can expel from these companies
There should not be a need for legislation on it in this House in the first place
These companies should not be in a situation where they are making excessive profits
They actually should give the money back because it is our money at the end of the day
They should be compelled to give this money back rather than having to use emergency legislation like this
I listened to the Tánaiste's statement
I have listened to those of other Ministers for Foreign Affairs on many occasions during my time here
The more I hear, the more I try to understand what is being said
The more statements that those in government come out with in respect of this issue, the less credibility they have when commenting on Palestine
It is lip service at its worst
There are a number of things the Government can do to change the narrative
I request that it strongly think about changing direction
There are a number of Bills before the Oireachtas
They are moderate in nature and would send a signal, not only to the people of Ireland but also to the State of Israel, that there will be sanctions in respect of the continued occupation of Palestine
If passed, the Bills in question would send a clear signal to the world and to the people of Palestine that we are on their side and that the State of Israel is accountable for its crimes
Jenin is an interesting place
It is a camp that dates back to 1953
The people there are refugees and descendants of those who were expelled in 1948
It is a camp that has suffered as a result of occupation for decades
For the past number of weeks, Israeli forces have been continuously going in there to murder people, without sanction
This is compounding the occupation, not only of Jenin, but of Palestine itself
That is the historic wrong of this situation
Palestinians have every right to challenge the occupation, just like people in the North of Ireland had a right to challenge British occupation
Whether they do so by force or by peaceful means, that is their prerogative
When people are oppressed and brutalised daily, no matter where they are in the world, they have a right to challenge and resist it
Again, there is a number of things this State can do
I refer to the Bills I mentioned earlier
However, the Government does not have the guts to do it
The reason is that it is afraid of the Americans, the EU and the Israeli embassy, which is located not too far from here
It is afraid of the consequences
I ask the Minister of State to think about that again
These are moderate Bills that would send a signal to the world with regard to the situation in Palestine
Another ongoing situation is that of the EU-Israel bilateral economic agreement, which is worth billions of euro per year
This increases exponentially in terms of trade
When you think about it, are there any consequences for what Israel does daily, weekly or annually, and for its apartheid system? There are none
Absolutely zero
It beggars belief as to why this continuously happens, but it is not a surprise
As we have heard here, it is lip service
There is no credibility, and we have lost all hope in this Government changing direction
The Irish people have a long history of fighting occupiers
We are on the side of the ordinary Palestinian people who are fighting against occupation and oppression
We will always be on their side
The Government has chosen to turn its back on the Palestinian people for the sake of credibility with the three forces I mentioned
I ask the Minister of State to think about what the Government could do with one of the Bills to which I refer
It could send a message across the world that there are consequences for apartheid, racism and oppression
A small country like Ireland stood against British imperialism for 800 years, and it could stand up and say it can do something
We did it in the 1980s with South Africa
We were a small country on the periphery of Europe
We said that what was happening thousands of miles away was brutal and horrible, but we stood in solidarity with the people of South Africa
Now we need to stand in solidarity with the people of Palestine
That is the best message we can send out from here
Many people in direct provision centres have leave to remain
Some of them have of late received letters from international protection accommodation services, IPAS, telling them to leave the centre for a different part of the country
Some residents, particularly those in Clondalkin Towers, have important jobs and are being educated locally
It is extremely unfair to ask them to leave Clondalkin or wherever to go to a different county
They lose their jobs and educational situation
Is the Minister aware of this policy? Is it the policy of the Government?
I commend the Minister of State for quite a positive statement
There has been a new appreciation of nature and our country since the pandemic
Even prior to that, there was a new appreciation for our seas, land, rivers, streams, mountains, beautiful parks and surroundings and mountains, which is a very good thing
There are six national parks in Ireland, dotted across almost each corner of the country
I am quite familiar with the Wicklow Mountains National Park
The State made a mistake by not buying Luggala House and the attached 5,000 acres three or four years ago
It was going for a song, essentially
It is a pity that did not happen because it would have been included in the Wicklow Mountains National Park
People can still use the environs, but it would have been a huge addition to the Wicklow Mountains National Park
National parks are accessible for all sorts of activities such as walking and taking in the outstanding beauty and biodiversity
They are hugely significant for our well-being as humans and for animals to cohabitate with everybody else
They are very positive
The Minister of State's statement was very good from the outset
I hope things can improve
There are enormous challenges regarding not only our national parks but nature as well
Other Deputies have spoken about invasive species
Rhododendron is a huge issue, particularly around Killarney and in other national parks
Resources must be put in to curtail it
If it is not curtailed, it will curtail nature
I am glad investment is being made in that regard
The Minister of State touched on the European Court of Justice and the number of issues around special areas of conservation, SAC, and some of the breaches
I understand that was from 2019 but that has been addressed, to a certain degree, which is welcome
I am quite passionate about issues around walking trails and waymarked walks in Ireland
We have some of the most extensive waymarked walks in Europe
A huge amount of people come from all over the world for these waymarked walks
They traverse the whole country and go into small villages which most people would probably not visit if it was not for the walks
They bring a huge amount of chances to meet people, see villages and have experiences they normally would not if they were in the car, etc
We should use our resources more and make better use of waymarked walks; they are under-used
The good thing about Ireland is that most of these waymarked walks go through people's land
There is a good sense of right of way, which is brilliant
They need to be developed more, particularly wilderness huts, of which there are very few
There are a few in Ballincroy and in the Wicklow Mountains National Park
I do not think there are any in the Connemara or Burren National Parks
There should be more of them
They are very eco-friendly
People camp, but wilderness camps are self-sufficient and people can sleep the night in a national park, which is a fantastic experience if you can do it
It is very positive
If the Minister of State could get rid of midgies at this time of year, I would vote for him for El Presidente
God, yes
I meant to say that about ticks
Yes, the odd midge
No ticks-----
-----but we always have a lot of flies
The Citizens' Assembly on Drugs Use is examining the issue of drug use and this is an important issue and assembly
Early indications are that the citizens in that assembly are moving towards a more progressive approach on drug use
That is welcome and it is a reflection of society but the big question is as follows: whatever the recommendations are, will this Government give a commitment to legislate on those recommendations during its lifetime? Without the law being changed, we will be back at square one, the way we are at the moment

People Before Profit welcomes and will support this motion
The A5 should have been completed a long time ago
One reason it has fallen behind is that, both North and South, environmental issues were not given any priority in the original design of the road
It was left to individual citizens, mainly in the North, to lobby and even go to court to try to compel the authorities to fulfil their duties regarding nature and biodiversity
The result has been delay after delay and serious cost overruns
The cross-Border dimension of the A5 highlights that problems of transport cannot be addressed within one part of this island
Whether it is roads or rail, we will either have all-island solutions or no solutions at all
Both North and South, there is an east-west divide
Belfast sucks investment at the expense of Derry and Fermanagh
Meanwhile, the growth of Dublin deprives Donegal and Sligo of a fair shot at fixing their problems
We need a transport system which leaves no county or region behind
The A5 has to be a key part of this, as does a decent rail service
If one took a map from 1920, one would see an extensive network of rail services that serviced that part of the island but now there is absolute desolation in relation to railway services
We need not to depend on roads and perhaps have an alternative to the car, and that should be rail services
Bringing the A5 up to standard will not solve all our transport problems but without a safe clean modern A5, it is hard to see how other transport challenges can be met
This is not a question of roads versus rail
It is notable that, generally speaking, the areas across the island with the worst roads are the areas with no rail service at all
One final lesson we can learn from the A5 saga is that the interests of the environment should be from the outset a central factor in the planning of any future infrastructural projects on this island
At present there are two occupations by Iceland workers, namely, in the stores in Talbot Street and Coolock
These workers are owed money for work they did
We saw something similar happen with unscrupulous employers such as Debenhams and Clerys
What is going on is what is called in the business "a strategic insolvency"
When will the Government - it has been in office for the past three and a half years - bring forward legislation to stop this happening and stop workers being screwed?
I will be brief
There is significant concern in respect of these two amendments
In light of the manner in which they were expedited, the Minster of State needs to reflect on the gravity of the amendments
This could have far-reaching consequences on free speech and how data are collected
I ask him to withdraw the amendments on the basis of democracy and respect for other Deputies
Ireland's health budget runs to €20 billion per year
Ireland spends roughly the same on healthcare
Ireland's health budget runs to €20 billion per year
Ireland spends roughly the same on healthcare
I will be sharing time with Deputy Barry
I thank Sinn Féin for this very important motion on nursing home and elder care
There are obviously viability issues in the nursing home sector and if we had the same speeches 25 years ago, we would be talking about a different composition of nursing home care
At that time in Ireland, it was 80% owned by the public and 20% owned by the private sector
That is now reversed
Whether that is a good or a bad thing is up for negotiation
I would say it is not a good structure as it is one that is largely based on profit
As Deputy Shortall said, 15 huge companies, that have billions in revenue, own 40% of all nursing home private beds
That is almost a monopoly on nursing home care and it is not a good structure
The fair deal scheme is not fit for purpose and it needs to be completely restructured
We have a different vista now about how our elders want to be treated in later life
Do people want to go to nursing homes? Most people do not; they want to be cared for at home
Sometimes that is not possible but we should put the infrastructure in place if it is possible for people to stay at home because that is where they are happier and more comfortable
In order to do that, the infrastructure has to be put in place
I refer to an issue around workers' pay, which is crucial to this issue
When we think about it, people who work in that care profession are very undervalued and underpaid
They do the most amazing job in society
They look after our parents, our friends, and people who we love but sometimes they are not recognised and are paid very poorly
It is a reflection on the society we have that the people who give everything and look after our loved ones are not paid properly
I will touch on the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response
The committee made a number of important points on the structure of nursing home care and identified serious weaknesses in that structure
It stated, "The State is over reliant on institutional care for our vulnerable population" and that we should move to a publicly-owned and funded model of care, rather than the system we have
Covid showed a huge amount of weaknesses in nursing home care, especially in the private sector
That is not to speak against the people who work in the private sector and the small owners, as they do an amazing job, but there are seriously worrying trends in how this is going
As others said, the small operators that run as family businesses are going to be squeezed and in a couple of years' time, we will not be talking about 20% private but 90% and the 40% private beds will probably be double, given the way things are going
We need to look at things in a different way
We are not going to do it here, but the trend is not going in the right direction
I, too, welcome the motion
We have discussed the issue of home care many times over the past number of years
It is an extremely important part of the healthcare system
It is vital that somebody in his or her own home is given the proper intervention and vital care at that time
We have moved towards the model where people want to stay in their homes, if it is medically feasible, because that is obviously where they feel more relaxed and more at home - excuse the pun
It is a better environment, both physically and mentally
All the evidence indicates that where a person gets a proper intervention, the outcomes are very good
The State has funded home care but it still lags behind the need, especially for people in a hospital setting who cannot leave that setting to come home
The home care approach and model is better
As I said, the evidence indicates people are happier and so forth
We are not only talking about those people who need home care but also the workers
Speaking as a former home care worker, it is a brilliant, rewarding job in more ways than one
You do not do it for the money
Nobody does it to get rich
You do it for the passion, the altruistic need, and wanting to give back to your fellow human beings
However, there is a major issue around pay
There is no doubt about that
The proliferation of privatisation of home care is a huge worry
A tendering process is under way
These companies are doing very well but their workers are struggling
It is to be hoped some of this can be addressed through the tendering process, including travel expenses
A home care worker who has ten clients will sometimes have to travel wide distances to get from one client to another
That takes up a lot of time
It has to be addressed because if we do not keep workers, we will have this situation all the time
A huge number of people want to give but cannot do so if they are not paid properly or recognised
That is important
The proliferation of privatisation has been a huge worry and has denigrated the service the State is obliged to provide
It is important to address that imbalance in home care work and to recognise home care
We live in a society possessed by financial rewards but we need to become a society that cares about its individual members
We are a caring society but there are things in place which do not help people who want to give
The main issues are more home care hours for people who need home care and proper pay and conditions
There are people in our society who earn hundreds of thousands of euro and sometimes you have to ask yourself what social good they do
The social good of a carer who is meeting the most basic needs of a fellow human being is vital
Sometimes we do not recognise that in a capitalist society
I hope the tendering process will give a living wage to those who want to give back and make people’s lives better
That is vital
We are having a very good debate on young people and the strategy around justice and so forth
Young people are sometimes maligned
They can be marginalised by society so it is important we give confidence and credit to their age group
The most important thing, if young people engage in activity they should not engage in, is to divert them away from the criminal justice system
The Garda diversion projects are very good
I have first-hand experience of such a project
It is a very good project that takes people away from things they should not be doing
We do not want young people getting into a career of criminality
There are also very good initiatives, such as late-night football leagues
They are a good tool for engaging young people in working-class communities
I will touch on a number of matters
We cannot talk about youth work without talking about the cuts that happened 15 years ago due to austerity
Funding of youth work throughout the State has been catching up and is still catching up
If there is no funding for engaging with young people, we will then have voids and resource issues
My substantial contribution will be on the document, Report on the Consultations with Young People for the Citizens Assembly on Drug Use
It outlines a number of very important issues that young people are thinking about and want to engage with
It raises a number of very important issues regarding how young people are affected by drug use or the harms caused by drugs and so forth
As I said, my first-hand experience is that when young people engage with criminal gangs, they go down a very dark cul-de-sac
Some very unscrupulous people will use young people for drug dealing and so forth
The main points outlined in the document are around treatment and support
A key issue is that of nonjudgmental harm reduction, in addition to legal reform, educational awareness and aspects of what drugs do to individual young people and their communities and families
This document is very important and way ahead of Government policy on how we deal with people in communities that have been blighted by drug use
The citizens' assembly document is very important in the whole context of drug use in this country
Young people are deeply affected, regardless of whether they take drugs, by the peer group through which drugs are in their community
I hope people get a chance to read this document, even if it is only the first six or seven pages
It gives an insight into how young people are thinking and what their outlook on this issue is, when they are sometimes forgotten about
The main thing is we have to look after our young people
We have to big them up
We do not need to malign them
There are sometimes all sorts of bad vibes on social media that can really play on people's minds, especially young people's minds, such as their association with anti-social behaviour
I hate that label
I hate it with a passion that young people are associated with anti-social behaviour just because they hang around corners
We all hung around corners
We all did that, but there is then a label that young people are engaged in anti-social behaviour
If young people hear that, what does it do to somebody's thinking? We have to be very careful about terminology and how we treat and listen to young people
It is very important that we listen to young people because, again, their voices are sometimes not heard
The contribution and say of the Citizens' Assembly on Drug Use outlined in this document are very important in respect of the recommendation we will get at the end of the year
My question concerns the ongoing situation in Tunisia
The Tunisian Government has increasingly become authoritarian in relation to journalists and political and civil rights activists
I wish to hear the Tánaiste's views on the ongoing situation, particularly Ireland and the EU's relationships with Tunisia
I thank the Tánaiste
As I said from the outset, a number of prominent politicians, trade union leaders and lawmakers have been imprisoned in recent months
It is very ironic, in the birthplace of the Arab Spring 12 years ago, that one dictator took over from another in 2011
He is oppressing his people and has used horrible and really xenophobic language against people of colour that is completely divisive
It is important that Ireland uses its influence via the EU, which is one of the biggest trading partners with Tunisia
It is important that we reflect our solidarity with the people of Tunisia
I do not have much else to add, but the issue of the funding that emanates from the EU and goes to Tunisia is important
There must be some sort of consequences in respect of what the Tunisian Government is doing
I say this because if we look at what happened several decades ago during the Ben Ali dictatorship, we can see that this Tunisian Government is doing exactly the same as he was doing, not only to the people of the country but to the opposition there
As a beacon of democracy and solidarity with the Tunisian people, surely the EU will have to stand up to this kind of xenophobic and authoritarian regime

At the health committee on Tuesday, the HSE stated that there is an over-reliance on the recruitment of international doctors and nurses
Nearly 40% of doctors and nurses in our health system are from overseas
Without them, our health system would not function
There is an anomaly in our system because undergraduate places for nursing are over-subscribed by 3:1
There needs to be more undergraduate places, particularly for nursing
Obviously, we produce amazing nurses in this country, but most people-----
People Before Profit welcomes the principle of this Bill but many will ask why it took so long to ban the sale of these products to under-18s
It is hard to believe that we are only introducing legislation now because vape products have been around for more than a decade
Questions have to be asked about that
There is no doubt that tobacco companies are luring young people in particular with very seductive packaging
There are thousands of flavours and you even see young people who are definitely under 18 using these products, including disposable products
It is not a good sign when young people are engaged in this kind of behaviour
I am not against vaping as such
It has a place when it comes to those who have come from smoking 20, 30 or 40 cigarettes per day to vaping
The genie is out of the bottle and you cannot ban vaping; that will be impossible
We should not go down the route that Australia has gone down as that will just drive it underground
There needs to be a better regulatory system because at the moment it is like the Wild West with flavours and who sells these products
The proliferation of vaping products has gone well beyond its remit and anybody can sell these products
Some of the people selling them are completely unscrupulous and they will sell them to anybody, so there needs to be a crackdown in the regulatory system and packaging
It would be very difficult to ban flavours and just have one nicotine flavour
There should be a small and limited number of flavours but if we just have one flavour, then that will not really work
We are all in agreement that we need to do something better because we do not want young people who never smoked taking up a bad habit
In the last 15 to 20 years there has been a huge reduction in the number of people smoking and that is a good thing
Can we have a tobacco-free world? That is impossible but we can do things better and more safely for people who choose to vape and they can vape in a safer manner
We do not need to ban products and we do not want to go down that route
If we go down the route of banning vaping completely, we will be coming back here in five years with a worse situation than we have; I guarantee that
Australia has made a huge mistake in banning vaping completely
Hopefully with this legislation and other legislation, particularly around packaging, we will have a better system than we have now
This week, Professor John Crown raised concerns regarding cancer patients with private health insurance in respect of not getting timely access to vital cancer medicines
There were major discrepancies regarding timely interventions by private health insurance companies
There were some waiting periods of up to two years in respect of these vital medicines
The Irish Cancer Society has stated there needs to be fairer access to drugs via standardisation through Sláintecare
Is it Government policy to standardise access to these vital medicines, whether patients are public or private?
I welcome this motion from Sinn Féin
It is very topical, very well thought out and very relevant to issues around respite
I worked in respite for a long time
It is an essential service for service users and families
It is like a home from home
You build friendships with clients and so forth and you really cannot put a price on that development, that friendship, that care and those surroundings
Respite care is an essential service
At the moment, however, its provision is arbitrary, to say the least
The majority of people who need respite care are not getting it
That is a real shame because when respite care is put in place, it can be hugely beneficial for everybody who needs it
We saw that even today from MS Ireland, and I think the Minister of State was at its facility in Bushy Park
It is an amazing facility but they cannot open it all year round
If they could get a small amount of money - in the greater scheme of things €700,000 is a small amount of money in respect of the health budget - they could open it all year round
That would be amazing because it is an amazing facility and that could be hugely beneficial for those with MS
I understand that there are issues around retention and recruitment, and there is no getting away from that
I think that is across the board as regards disability services
However, we need to put everything in place to fix that because if we do not do so, we will continuously have this debate on staff and pay and the issues around that
Again, it is a real shame we are talking about this
We come to debates such as these, and they are worthy, but we should not be talking about this kind of stuff because this stuff should be in action and in place
If it were in place, we would not be talking about it and these services would be given to families who really need them
As I said, my experience of respite care has been that it is an integral part of people's development, and that relationship between the person, the family and the caregivers is an essential part of care
If we are not doing that as a society awash with money, if we cannot do that, there is something fundamentally wrong with our health service
My question relates to the Minister's discussions with senior gardaí on the policing of anti-asylum seeker and anti-refugee demonstrations across the State
Many of us are concerned about what has manifested in the State and the situations in which police find themselves
Some lines have been crossed at some of the demonstrations
There is no doubt about that
It is unequivocal
Outside agitators are trying to sow fears and play on people's fears and hatred
Some of these are outside agitators who have an agenda, that is, to stoke fear and so forth
It is a testament to the Irish people that we have welcomed the vast majority of people to this country
There has been a considerable influx of people from different parts of the world and, largely, Irish people have welcomed people from different countries
We know the feelings of being rejected and then welcomed
It is part of our DNA to welcome people, but there are those who want to stoke the worst in people and they have an agenda
I fear the rhetoric they use, especially on social media, is going unchecked
We understand the police find themselves in difficult situations, but there are also question marks over where those lines have been blurred at demonstrations
Remember these demonstrations are outside where people live
Some of the policing has to be questioned
It is very light touch in comparison to what the Debenhams workers went through two years ago
There is a stark contrast in how the gardaí dealt with them and how the people who are stoking up the worst fears imaginable
The gardaí find themselves in a difficult situation in which outside forces are trying to whip up fear, hatred and division
They grow in that cesspool
It has to be acknowledged that these people have to be taken out of society

This is the fifth anniversary of an historic referendum that changed Ireland
It gave a generational view to a new Ireland
It is in that context, and also in the context of the review by Marie O'Shea BL and the proposed Bill, that we are talking about abortion services in Ireland
The current legislation, as Ms O'Shea has said, is not fit for purpose
Ms O'Shea is unequivocal in her review and critique that the legislation put together four or five years ago needs to be updated
Hundreds of women and girls are being let down by the State with the current legislation
The Minister has said, not in the Chamber but elsewhere, that there is an arbitrary nature to the provision of abortion services in Ireland
Eight publicly funded hospitals are not providing abortion services to women
In the time this Government has left, it must implement the recommendations of the review
The issue here is not only the review but also the people of this country who voted overwhelmingly in 2018 to progress abortion services
It is clear from the review that the legal framework for the services needs to change
The Joint Committee on Health will critique Marie O'Shea's review but it is up to the Government to put forward a new framework for implementing the recommendations
That is not the job of the committee, as previous speakers have noted
It is up to the Government to implement those changes in the time remaining to it
The people of this country have moved on, as has the report, but the women of Ireland are still being left behind under the current legislation
This is about trust
We trust women with regard to accessing abortion services in Ireland
I will not use my entire ten minutes
I will probably take less than five
I welcome the motion tabled by Sinn Féin
We have had many debates on this issue
We probably cannot have enough debates about our health system
As it is, our health system is good, when people can get access to it
We have some of the best doctors, nurses, healthcare assistants and clerical staff in Europe
They are a very highly motivated and educated workforce, but there are mitigating circumstances whereby there is a schism between public and private
Over the course of the pandemic, we saw that no country could prepare for what was coming down the line, but front-line staff in each hospital stepped up to the plate in the most trying circumstances that could ever be imagined
I am sure people who were qualified doctors and nurses with years of experience could never have imagined that they would be up against something like Covid, but we pulled through
Many people died but the system saw itself through
However, many cracks were seen
The cracks in our health service are largely down to the divide of the inequalities
These are the historical inequalities between public and private
The current situation in Ireland is unique in Europe in that 50% of our citizens rely on private health insurance
It is very weird that 50% of people have to rely on private health insurance because we have a divided system
I am sure people who have private health insurance want universal healthcare
Such healthcare, as seen across different parts of Europe and the world, is much better because whether somebody is on social welfare or is a millionaire, they get the same healthcare
That is a much better system for society and, most important, for the people who need that care
One of the most crucial issues in our health service at present is the retention of staff
As I said, staff are very highly educated and very motivated but retaining that staff is a significant challenge, in the context of their working environment
Certain situations in our emergency departments are just not conducive to a safe working environment
There are situations where people have to go to work but are slightly frightened, to say the least
They are frightened as there is not a high enough ratio of staff to patients for people who are in that environment to actually look after certain medical situations
That is a fact
I have friends who work in the health service, as we all do
They are highly motivated and educated people who want to go to work but they are in situations that are completely unsafe
The Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation has consistently said this
That has to be addressed
We do not want people who are newly qualified - some people want new experiences and to go to Australia and so forth, which is understandable - on a conveyor-belt system where they get fed up, burnt out and have to leave two or three years after qualifying
We just do not want that because we will have this conveyor-belt system as regards new staff
That is not a good situation to have
As I said, universal healthcare, including Sláintecare, is a very good concept
For probably the first time in the history of this House, even those from the party of the Minister of State who have supported private healthcare now understand that a system of universal healthcare, or Sláintecare, would be much better
We largely agree on that
Sláintecare is a good concept but it is going very slowly
Its implementation is extremely slow
That needs to be fast-forwarded
The creeping privatisation in our system is very worrying
I go back to the historical legacy of the 1980s and 1990s when hundreds if not thousands of beds were taken out of our public health system
We are playing catch-up
We are a very wealthy country
We are one of the wealthiest countries in the world
We should have a health system where people, regardless of their income, are treated properly
We all agree with that but it is not happening
There are pinch points, particularly around emergency departments and waiting lists
There are people who have been on waiting lists for years
That is just not acceptable at all
Once we fix all those pinch points, then we can have truly universal healthcare in Ireland
I congratulate the Independent Group on the motion
It is quite wide ranging
We would like to see all of that implemented as soon as possible
The pandemic showed us many things about our health service, our country and ourselves
There was a collective spirit
It was a very dark time in our history but there was a collective effort to look after each other in our public service
The front-line workers were up against something that was unprecedented in the history of any health service in the last 100 years
Massive sacrifices were made
Collectively we came out of that in a better way in some ways
However, serious inequalities showed themselves in respect of private and public healthcare and the historical legacies of capacity in Ireland
Over the last 30 or 40 years, thousands of beds have been taken out of the public health service
We are living with that capacity issue today
There is a lot of debate around universal healthcare
The majority of people in this country would support universal healthcare
A good example is the NHS in Britain
It is not perfect by any means but it is a much better system than we have here at the moment
Some 50% of people in Ireland still rely on private health insurance
That is not the fault of those people but they think they will have a better chance accessing healthcare privately rather than through the public system
That has to be addressed
They are historical inequalities that lead to really bad outcomes for a lot of people
Retention and recruitment is the most important issue of our time
It is about keeping staff in this country while there is a crisis in housing
We need to keep staff here rather than having to go abroad
I commend Deputy Brady on the Bill
It is quite a modest Bill and is in line with the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions movement across the world to condemn apartheid Israel
The Minister of State and his Government have a chance to send a message not only to apartheid Israel, but to the world
Can he imagine the message going out that an Irish Government has finally taken the stance, through a modest Bill such as this, that there must be economic consequences to apartheid? Last week, we saw how distorted and racist Israel is
Israel bombed a house in the Gaza Strip last week, killing eight children
When asked by a journalist whether Israel can take responsibility for murdering eight children, the Israel Defense Forces commander said, "We'll look into it
" After the murder of eight children, he said, "We'll look into it
" What sort of barbarians are these people? What sort of savages are we talking about? After the killing of eight children, he shrugs his shoulders and says, "We'll look into it
"  Israel is not a normal state but the Minister of State's Government, successive Governments and governments throughout the European Union keep treating it like a normal state
We can do something
Some of us feel powerless here but we can do something, such as passing Senator Black's Control of Economic Activity (Occupied Territories) Bill 2018 and this Bill to send the message to Israel that there are consequences to occupation
By not challenging apartheid, the Minister of State is complicit in it
There has been 75 years of occupation and brutality
There has also been 75 years of silence
More importantly, there has been 75 years of resistance by the Palestinian people against occupation and 75 years of international solidarity that sees the people of Palestine being constantly oppressed by a racist regime
There have to be economic, political and diplomatic consequences for Israel
It constantly gets away with it
The murder of eight children last week was just one action of the murderous regime in Israel
It will constantly get away with this if the Government does not tell the Israeli ambassador to get the hell out and that we do not want her here because of Israel's constant murder of children
If there are no consequences, a murderous regime like Israel's will constantly do things like this until people stand up
The Palestinian people constantly stand up to Israel
Now it is up to Ireland, the Irish Government and the Irish people, to say that we have had enough of apartheid in Israel
As a country, we need to stand up
Supporting this Bill is one way of sending that message out
I thank the Ceann Comhairle
I am out of breath
It is an important question
Hold on and I will catch my breath
It is a very quick question for the Taoiseach on the medical card review
I am aware there was a report in 2014 around the expert panel and medical card eligibility
Will the review take place soon on the system of discretionary medical cards and the remit for those who have a terminal illness or who have cancer? People who do not have a terminal illness are finding it very difficult to get a medical card in the context of costs and so on
This question relates to a clarification on any plans either to penalise workers who avail of car-parking spaces in their workplaces or to remove those spaces
I thank the Minister
The Climate Change Advisory Council has called on the Government to implement a levy on workers who get free parking in urban areas
The idea behind that is to change individual behaviour
However, as the Minister has stated, I am sure people do not want to be in their cars for hours on end
It is the last thing they want on their way to work
However, there are cases where there are no alternatives, particularly public transport alternatives
More than ever, people are cycling, availing of a car pool, or walking or running to work
That is very good
However, if there are no alternatives to the use of a car, particularly public transport alternatives, I do not see how the Government could take this provision away from ordinary workers, particularly front-line workers who have no alternatives to their cars
If public transport links around the country were better, people would avail of them rather than being stuck in their cars
It is in legislation from 2008
The Minister will not be signing off on the measure
There is a provision in the Finance Bill 2008 that can be signed by the Minister to introduce a levy on workers
It is good that he will not be signing that
There is a lot of corporate greenwashing going on
I will give the Minister an example
Liffey Valley Shopping Centre introduced staff car-parking charges in October 2022
The average workers, who may not have an alternative to the use of a car, will pay €600 per year to park their cars to go to work
That is the equivalent of a pay cut for workers who are on an average wage
The shopping centre has introduced sustainable travel between cycling and public transport but the public transport links were not there when that decision was made
This is corporate greenwashing at its worst because it penalises ordinary workers just to come to work
This question relates to a clarification on any plans either to penalise workers who avail of car-parking spaces in their workplaces or to remove those spaces
I thank the Minister

On Tuesday last, Palestinian political prisoner Khader Adnan died in an Israeli prison
He was on hunger strike for 87 days and was held in what the Israelis called administrative detention, in other words, internment
The blame for his death lies solely and squarely with apartheid Israel
We should know about the long history of fighting colonialism via hunger strikes
When will the Tánaiste contact the Israeli ambassador to state his outrage about this issue? When is the time to cut diplomatic and foreign links with apartheid Israel?
Why did we do it in the 1980s?
Why would the Tánaiste want to deal with a murderous regime such as Israel? The Tánaiste is yellow
I too want to welcome the spirit of this motion
We have discussed this issue on many occasions and it is extremely important
Independent living for those who are living with a disability is a fundamental civil right
This includes the right to work, the right to travel and the right to live
In the past, the situation for those who were living with disabilities was one of exclusion, marginalisation and stigmatisation
That happened in the past
While we have gladly moved on, there is such a long way to go in relation to disability rights in Ireland
The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, was very welcome, but the optional protocol is still a vital part of disability rights
An issue that is very important is accessibility of transport for those who have a disability
As Deputy Boyd Barrett has said, the Access For All campaign has been really good in highlighting the issues that able-bodied people take for granted
There is the very simple issue of lifts in train stations that just do not work
While we can go down the stairs, that is just not possible for those who are in a wheelchair
If a lift does not work, then a person cannot access the train
Can you imagine how demoralising that feels for somebody who is in a wheelchair? It is really demoralising
That should not be the way
Thankfully, Irish Rail has tried to address some of these issues where lifts should be working
They are the basics
Even accessing trains and buses is quite difficult
You have to give prior warning and so forth
If you want to travel on the Dublin Express to Dublin Airport, you have to give 48 hours' notice
You have to give 24 hours' notice for the inter-county buses
You have to plan your day and make your travel plans
Nobody's life should be subject to availability
These things should become as normal as possible for those who are in this situation
It is important the Government listens to those who are campaigning when it comes from the heart and from real-life experience
The motion sets out a number of issues, including the fact the primary medical certificate needs to be reformed in a big way
It is very arbitrary and completely outdated and it needs to be reformed in a big way
Many people have contacted my office about it and they are extremely frustrated about how it works
It needs to be updated, revised and reformed in order that people who need access to that form of funding can get it
My question is the same as that of Deputy Bacik
The INMO is holding its annual conference today
A survey by the organisation found 65% of nurses and midwives felt patient safety was at risk and conditions were not conducive to a safe workplace
Something important the Government can do is to implement the safe staffing framework
It should be implemented and underpinned by legislation
That would be conducive to a safe environment for healthcare professionals and also patients
I pose the question and, obviously, the Bill poses the question: what is wrong with rent control?What is wrong with making rent, in relative terms, affordable for renters? What is wrong with stopping the market-led approach that has led to spiralling rents? Thanks to spiralling rents, we now have a generation that is not only locked out but is turning to emigration
Many young people now are looking at the alternatives
They cannot find a place to rent and are faced with the possibility of having to emigrate
That is not a good thing
These people are well educated and want to play a role in this society, but because of the current situation, they are being forced to leave their home
We are facing a crazy situation
In Dublin Mid-West, for example, hundreds of people will turn up to view one house
This is not an isolated situation but is happening right across the country
Prospective tenants who are accessing the housing assistance payment, HAP, can forget about it
They will not get near any available house
In fact, even if they are accessing homeless HAP, their chances of getting a house are extremely slim
If they do manage to get a house, they are facing the prospect of paying a top-up
It can be seen how the rental situation is both spiralling and inflationary
A number of weeks ago a two-bedroom apartment in Lucan became available for €2,300 per month, but because there was so much demand, the people who owned it increased the price by €150
How can that be justified? That is an incredible amount of money
People simply cannot afford these prices
They are being set aside and humiliated, in some ways, in terms of getting access to homes
The situation the country finds itself in is related to Government policy, which has led to a lack of public and affordable homes and a lack of rental accommodation
This situation is down to policy
There is a reason for everything
The reason we have such a dire housing situation, with 11,000 people in emergency accommodation, is Government policy
It is not some sort of natural phenomenon
It is the result of the policies of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, particularly the former which has been in power for the past 12 years
Fine Gael has overseen this disaster
If Government was a business, Fine Gael would be thrown out of business
The system is broken, not only for renters but also for those on the council waiting lists and those who want to buy
Rents in Dublin and across the country are spiralling out of control
What is wrong with controlling rents? The rent pressure zones are only cosmetic
We need proper rent control, as happens in other countries and other cities
Others have introduced rent controls because they know that if the rental sector is market led, property owners will seek to maximise profit
There is nothing radical about rent control
Indeed, it is quite rudimentary and mainstream
It is about controlling rents in certain areas so that they are reasonable and affordable
It is about ensuring corporate and individual landlords do not completely profiteer from housing
If we allow the market-led approach to continue, the situation across the country will persist, not only for renters but for everybody across the board
A number of weeks ago, Deputy Wynne, who is a Deputy for Clare, and I visited Patrick Moore in Limerick Prison
Patrick is a father of two
He was sentenced to five years in prison and his crime was simply helping people with medicinal cannabis
We spoke to Patrick and his wife
It was very moving to hear that Patrick has been in prison for that time because he helped others
There was a change in the law in 2019 around the medical cannabis access programme
Fewer than 30 people can get access via a prescription
This programme needs to be expanded so that people do not have to go to people like Patrick, be sent to prison or, even worse, go without
My question centres around the review of the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018
The review has been published and, hopefully, the Minister will be able to furnish that in the coming weeks
That is welcome, but people will want to know when the review will become public and the mechanism
Obviously, it has to be brought before the Cabinet
Will it go before the health committee? It would be good for members of that committee to scrutinise it
It is nearly five years since the referendum, which is hard to believe, and four years since the legislation was implemented
There are anomalies, to say the least, in the legislation, particularly concerning the three-day period
That has always been an obstacle to women, as has the 12-week limit
The current legislation needs to be reformed to make it accessible and to make it easier for women to access abortion care
Can the Minister state when the report will be made available to Deputies or the health committee, and also to the public? Several people have probably read the review
Does the report recommend legislative change? Regarding the fundamentals of the current legislation, there is a lot to be changed, including in regard to the 12-week period and the criminalisation of doctors
Doctors are in a grey area regarding abortion services, particularly in respect of fatal foetal abnormalities
There is a huge grey area and doctors could be criminalised
Therefore, there is much to be examined regarding the review
Can the Minister indicate when it will be made public? Does it indicate to him that the current legislation needs to be changed?
This month?
My question centres around the review of the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018
The review has been published and, hopefully, the Minister will be able to furnish that in the coming weeks
That is welcome, but people will want to know when the review will become public and the mechanism
Obviously, it has to be brought before the Cabinet
Will it go before the health committee? It would be good for members of that committee to scrutinise it
It is nearly five years since the referendum, which is hard to believe, and four years since the legislation was implemented

What plans does the HSE have for holistic, neuro-focused and multidisciplinary long Covid clinics?
I thank the Minister
We welcome that
A conference on long Covid is due to be held today
We are only beginning to understand the evolution of long Covid
Many have been affected by this extremely debilitating condition
We probably all know someone who is suffering from it
In some circumstances, it has changed their life and put it on hold
Some people who had been very healthy contracted Covid and their lives changed, although the good news is the vast majority will recover from long Covid
People who are in that position want to access the best interventions possible in respect of not only respiratory issues but also cognitive impairment
Sometimes the latter is lost in all the intervention that we are talking about regarding long Covid
That is all welcome
It is important that the State recognises that long Covid is prevalent and the vast majority of people will make a full recovery as long as they get the intervention, which is most important
A major concern is waiting times for those suffering from long Covid
At present, it can be up to a year before they can get that intervention
That is probably not good at all because of the evolution of long Covid
It can last longer than even a year but generally the symptoms, if somebody is to make a full recovery, will probably just go beyond nine months to a year
That is generally the trend of long Covid but the waiting times are a huge concern for those who want to access those multidisciplinary interventions that they should receive

Organised crime is an insidious reality and those who participate in that insidious reality are some of the most unscrupulous people who will use particularly grotesque violence and intimidation to achieve their ends
They are highly organised, motivated and adaptable because of the vast profits of the black or alternative economy
When inequality and poverty are factors, some people will go down the route of the alternative economy
That is no excuse
Many people who come from working-class areas never go down the road of organised crime but a small number of people from these and other communities participate in this activity
One of the main drivers of organised crime is the supply and distribution of drugs
It is the key driver of organised crime
When controlled drugs in the State are controlled by organised crime we have a problem
The controlled drugs that people use are controlled by the black market, which is highly profitable and insidious in areas of our life
The proliferation of all drugs in the past five decades has exponentially increased, as has our prison population
What does that say about the laws of the land? We have to go back to the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977, which reflected what had happened in Britain a few years previously, to see when a deterrent to the supply or use of drugs was introduced
Anyone in this Chamber who tells me this legislation had the desired effect is fooling themselves
It has not and, in fact, it has vastly enriched a tiny number of people in our society
There is a narrative, one that I would argue, that we need to look at something very different from what we have at the moment
The alternative is to take back control
We must stop criminalising people for using drugs
People use drugs for all kinds of reasons
As I said, the black market largely controls drugs
It is highly profitable and we need to take back control
That control has many strands to it
We are having a debate about decriminalisation in the Citizens' Assembly on Drugs Use
That is a good and important debate
I hope the citizens' assembly will make recommendations to look at approaches different from the  The vast majority of people in Irish prisons are there for drug-related crimes
This approach does not work
We need to do something different
I do not think most people will agree with me when I say, and I do so genuinely, that we have to do something radically different from the paradigm of prohibition
It is about decriminalising the person
People will use drugs, regardless of whether they are legal
We have to stop criminalising people who want to use drugs
It is also a factor that people will use and enjoy drugs
Drugs have been around for millennia
People will want to alter their minds
If they want to do that, why criminalise them? Why bring them through the criminal justice system? That approach simply has not worked
We must look at radical alternatives as regards regulation and legalisation of certain drugs
There is even a debate to be had about the regulation of all drugs
It is quite a nuanced debate
There are many reasons people turn to drugs
Many people will use drugs but never abuse them
Moralising about people using drugs, which I am surprised the Minister did, does not sit well
Saying they are part of a criminal circle or that by using drugs they are somehow endorsing the black market and criminality does not wash
People do not think about that when they are using drugs
They are thinking of other issues, such as whether the drugs will have an effect on them
This is a complex issue
We must look at different models because the current model does not work
Criminalising people does not work
It only enriches a certain number of people in society
The radical approach is to decriminalise drugs and have a wider debate around regulation
If we look around the world, it is clear we cannot police our way out of the drug industry or drug world
It is impossible
As I said, people use drugs for all sorts of reasons
It is a brutal reality and it can be extremely ugly
I have seen what drugs have done to people very close to me and it is horrible
Based on my life experience, I believe we need to do something different
Criminalising people does not work because, again, it only enriches a tiny number of people in our society
We need to do something different and I hope the citizens' assembly will come back with a different model from the one we have at the moment
I am sorry about that
I am sorry about that
I will address that later on
My question to the Minister is about what his Department is doing to inform all public bodies of their immediate obligations under the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, CRPD, to prioritise disabled people's organisations, DPOs, in all consultations affecting disabled people
I thank the Minister for his comprehensive response
The UNCRPD was ratified about five years ago in this Parliament, and I am sure the Minister agrees it is a very good convention
It is rights-based and it has living with a disability at the heart of it
We must continue the dialogue with that group of people and the groups advocating on their behalf
It is very important they have a say and that the approach is a rights-based one
Service providers and those who advocate for people with a disability do great work
There should be more intervention with DPOs
At the moment, only a limited number of organisations in the State are led by DPOs, which is out of kilter with the aspirations of the convention
I again thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply
I want to get his thoughts on the ratification of the optional protocol
When the UNCRPD was ratified some years ago, this was omitted, which I think was a big mistake
Many groups, including those advocating for people with a disability, have said its omission by the Government was a big mistake
Does the Minister have plans to ratify the optional protocol during his tenure?

This question concerns PhD researchers from non-EEA countries
There is a national review of State supports for PhD researchers generally taking place and last week hundreds of these researchers were outside Leinster House to highlight the issues they face with their work
It is a tricky one for me as well
As I said, hundreds of PhD researchers were outside Leinster House last week to highlight the issue of their pay and conditions
There are over 10,500 such researchers and their hourly rate is below the minimum wage at present
It is difficult to survive on that
I think the stipend is €19,000 at the moment and researchers are calling for more than that due to the cost-of-living crisis and the cost of living in the State generally
PhD researchers are excluded from social welfare benefits because they are paid so little they do not earn PRSI contributions
The review is therefore important, and I hope it will be favourable for PhD students, wherever they come from
As the Minister said it is about keeping their talent in the country and the importance of their giving the benefit of their education and talent to the country
I thank the Minister
I think we all agree the composition of PhD researchers as a group is quite disparate and that it is important they are kept in this country
They are educators, ultimately, and should not have to struggle with their everyday needs
I hope the review leads to an increase in the stipend
When will the review be published? The researchers are eager to hear what will come of it
We hope it will benefit all PhD researchers in the country

The Government recently announced that a consultative forum will be set up to address Ireland's broader foreign policy
Nobody is afraid of debate and discussion but what many people are afraid of is the erosion of Ireland's neutrality
The Tánaiste may argue to the contrary but all of the soundings in recent times, particularly around the triple lock mechanism, as well as on Ireland's involvement in EU battle groups, permanent structured co-operation, PESCO, and the use of Shannon Airport, point to that
We must remember that US troops went through Shannon Airport and murdered tens of thousands of Iraqi troops
Where does the Tánaiste stand in relation to Ireland's neutrality? Will he give a commitment that a referendum will be held on our neutrality?
I never said that
No, the actions of the Government say it
Over the next few months, many people will find themselves in a situation they never thought they would be in, namely potentially being homeless
It is not their choice; rather, it is the choice of this Administration
I am sure I speak for everybody when I say I hope that scenario does not happen and that families or individuals who cannot even get emergency accommodation will not have to go to a police station or airport
That is now within the realm of possibility
If that happens, and it could happen, the damage for the Government is something from which it will not recover
The optics of families having to go to police stations would be unforgivable
In those circumstances, what measures has the Government put in place in terms of contingencies for families if they find there is no emergency accommodation available? That is the question everyone wants answered

I too commend the Labour Party on its very timely motion
Many schools across the State will be disappointed and anxious at this time because of the delay over construction
One particular school in my constituency is the Holy Family Community School in Rathcoole
It was built in the 1980s for 500 pupils and now has 1,000 pupils
Rathcoole is a burgeoning area that has seen massive growth in both construction and people, which is very welcome
Residents, pupils and teachers want to know about the construction of a new build
That is very important
This was at an advanced stage
Pupils and teachers had thought the work was going to begin very soon
It has been thrown into jeopardy as regards new construction
These educational spaces are just not conducive to a workplace
Some of the conditions that pupils and teachers find themselves in are pretty unbelievable in the 21st century
Some schools are outdated and antiquated
That is not me being negative
Just down the road from Rathcoole are some amazing schools the State has built in the past 15 years: beautiful aesthetic buildings, beautiful space and beautiful educational builds
The schools will want to know when Rathcoole in this instance will get the go-ahead in respect of construction
A number of other schools are in the same position, including Coláiste Pobail Fóla and Gaelscoil Lir in Saggart and Citywest
These are also areas that have seen massive growth in people, which is a good thing but people want to see schools and other construction in place
There are over 900,000 people on some form of public hospital waiting list
The Irish Hospital Consultants Association, IHCA, stated it would take up to a decade to address that legacy issue
Its main thesis regarding the national treatment purchase fund, NTPF, and the figures was capacity in all forms around acute situations and all forms of the hospital environment
This is a legacy issue that goes back decades, particularly to when Fianna Fáil was in government and slashed thousands of beds out of public hospitals
What is this Government doing to address the underlying issues of 900,000 people on some form of waiting list?

My question is on the decision taken by the Government in January to withdraw Irish troops from the Golan Heights to participate in the European battle group
We believe this is a breach and an erosion of Irish neutrality
I would like to hear the Minister's comments on that
I disagree on the basis that there have been soundings, even from the Minister, and from other Ministers, on Ireland's neutrality
Let us look at the evidence
Why would Ireland participate in an EU battle group in the first place? Permanent structured co-operation, PESCO, also comes into play, as does the use of Shannon Airport as a military base
Millions of American troops have gone through Shannon Airport and they participated in a number of wars that killed hundreds of thousands of people in the Middle East
The evidence points towards an erosion by stealth of our neutrality which is being undermined by this Government
This is not me being paranoid; the evidence is there
Surely our participation in battle groups and PESCO has to undermine our neutrality
I disagree again
Prior to the Minister stepping down as Taoiseach before Christmas, he went to the Council of the European Union and one of the main issues there was strengthening security and defence
All the evidence points towards the development of a European army when it comes to Ireland's neutrality and its place in the world, which has deep respect across the international community
We have said many times that the evidence points to PESCO and participation in European battle groups eroding our neutrality and that is what is at stake
Soundings from the Minister and other Ministers in the Government have shown that
They have stated that the triple lock mechanism is also up for grabs
The evidence is there
Again, this is not me being paranoid
The evidence is there that our role as a neutral country is under threat
I never said that

It is good that we are having this debate
There are serious issues around staffing levels in some of the hospitals in the State and particularly in emergency departments
This has been exacerbated by overcrowding and the inadequate bed capacity
The environment is not conducive to safety for the staff or the patients
There is something fundamentally wrong when nursing staff from emergency departments say the situation is dangerous
It is around staffing levels and where people can sometimes wait for days in emergency departments
This is a very wealthy country
This is not rocket science
We are talking about a system where people would be treated in time and with respect
This has a knock-on effect on staff morale and retention and recruitment
The new HSE CEO, Mr
Bernard Gloster, was before the Joint Committee on Health during the week
He said in his opening statement that one of the most important issues in his tenure is staff recruitment and retention
It is extremely important - I cannot overemphasise it - that we retain the staff we have right now
If we do not retain them, there will be a spiral whereby highly motivated and educated staff who want to stay in the Irish health system will not be able to do so because of the housing situation and because of being burned out
They want to partake in this environment but the situation is not conducive to this
That is a very important point
The new CEO said he would make it one of the most important elements of his tenure
As to the framework for safe staffing and skill mix, it is a good concept but it needs to be fully implemented
I have worked in hospital environments before and I know the most fundamental part of working in such an environment is having the proper skill mix, whether you are a healthcare assistant or a nurse
Everybody needs this
However, once that is out of kilter - it happens on a regular basis - people will die
There will be situations where people cannot be attended to
This is how serious it is
The framework is a very good concept, but it is kind of arbitrary in its implementation
There was very good news today for 35 children in the State who live with cystic fibrosis
The families and Cystic Fibrosis Ireland have fought very hard on the injustice of these 35 children not having access to certain drugs
There are huge lessons to be learned, not only with regard to reimbursement but also around companies like Vertex International, the pharmaceutical company that is based in Dublin
This company has made a grotesque amount of profit, particularly on this drug
These profits run not into millions but billions of euro
The lesson must be learned as to why these companies have governments and, more importantly, families over a barrel with regard to accessing these drugs
What lessons are to be learned considering that we have a huge pharmaceutical industry in Ireland?
I did not say that
Deputy Shortall is next
I, too, welcome this Bill
It is quite progressive and long overdue
We always said that inpatient charges have not been conducive to a universal public health service
This has been very contentious in the last number of decades
We have always argued that inpatient charges have been a barrier to many people gaining access to healthcare
Even the collection of these charges is an onerous and bureaucratic task
I do not think a public health service should be chasing after people for inpatient charges
Obviously, that has a very stressful effect on people who have to access healthcare
Debt collection by debt collectors is not acceptable for people who have run up a bill
People cannot work because of their illness and debt collectors are sending them letters
They may have come out of a very serious illness
That is not conducive to universal healthcare in a fair system
This Bill is welcome
All these stealth charges have an effect on people trying to access healthcare
I will mention a number of issues regarding hospital car parking charges
I could never understand, and nobody could ever convince me, why people have to pay car parking charges in hospitals
I do not see the logic in it at all
I do not see the logic that when people go to hospital, they must sometimes pay enormous amounts of money per week to park their cars
Sometimes they have to bring their cars to the hospital
I just do not get that
Could somebody explain to me why people have to be charged to go to hospital and park their car? Sometimes public transport is not available, and they are then charged for parking
It is disappointing that the national children's hospital charges for car parking
It has capped it at €10 per day, but if a person has to go to hospital every day with his or her child, that is €50 over one week
I do not get that
Can the Minister properly explain why car parking charges per day are being implemented in the national children's hospital? The Minister referenced Kaftrio earlier in his speech
There is obviously good news for those 35 children who now have access to that drug
I raised this with the Taoiseach today
I believe that what this company did was unforgivable
Vertex Pharmaceuticals is based in Dublin
To drag this out for one year and to deny those children that drug for one year is absolutely unforgivable, given that the amount of money Vertex Pharmaceuticals made from the drug is absolutely obscene
They have made billions, not millions, of dollars yet they dragged this out with the HSE
I do not actually blame the Government on this
I blame the company for dragging this out to get more money from the Government and from families
It is unforgivable and the Minister would probably agree with me that this should not have been dragged out for one year
Those 35 children should have got that drug when they needed it
While it is good that they have it now, it is unforgivable that pharmaceutical companies have the Government over a barrel with regard to pricing
I am aware that the company has a monopoly on it but it is unforgivable given the obscene amount of money they have made from this drug alone
Hopefully this will never happen again
There are lessons to be learned about reimbursement and children not being given a drug when they need it
A number of days ago, I received a very difficult email from a mother who experienced bereavement of her baby girl, Izzy, who was stillborn
Pregnancy after loss is deeply profound
In this email, Celine states that her healthcare professionals, had they known prior of her stillbirth, would have provided a much better assessment and aftercare for the trauma she experienced
Celine proposes that a specific sticker can be placed on the chart of the bereaved mother
Celine says this would make an enormous difference to the aftercare of herself and her child
She begs, in the email, for this to be introduced in most maternity hospitals in Ireland
As a person who did not really know about this subject, I think it is quite rudimentary for something to be put on somebody's file, whether it is a paper file or a digital file, that this mother has experienced bereavement
I move amendment No
2:In page 8, between lines 2 and 3, to insert the following: 
            (a) the projects at Shannonbridge and Tarbert generating stations (or at any alternative appropriate sites), and (b) the operation of the alternative assessments for these projects by the Environmental Protection Agency
(2) The Minister shall further report on Government proposals to delete the relevant sections of this Act once these projects have been completed
It is self-explanatory and calls for, within three months of the passing of the Act, the Minister to report to the Dáil on substantial issues
I look forward to the Minister’s response
That is disappointing
It is a rudimentary amendment
It is disappointing that there would not be a report on the passing of the legislation
The substantial issue was not dealt with in the Minister’s response
It is disappointing he has not accepted this amendment on the report on the issue of the committee
Some weeks ago, I was invited by the principal of St
Ronan's National School in Bawnogue in Clondalkin, which is a couple of minutes from where I live, to visit the school
It is a fantastic place for the young people of the area
It is a DEIS school
Several prefabs were built there in the 1990s and to say they are in a state of disrepair would be an understatement
In fact, last year the school commissioned a report on the state of the classrooms and forwarded this to the Department of Education
It found they were not fit for purpose
When I and other public representatives visited the classrooms, I could not believe that children were being taught and teachers were working in conditions like these in this State
I will send the Tánaiste the report and I will ask him next week if he thinks these conditions are acceptable
If this was a more affluent area, it would not be accepted
No-----
I will send the Tánaiste the report
Just look at this report
I will send the report to the Tánaiste
It has
I know
This has been going on for decades
The school is----
Yes, I understand
The Tánaiste does not know this area
I would like to thank the Regional Group for this important and timely debate on emergency services
I commend the emergency services, which continue to provide everybody with emergency cover
We all have emergencies during one part of our lives
The services do a crucial job in protecting us and our families and friends
That has to continue
The pandemic has thrown up a significant number of challenges with healthcare
During the pandemic, emergency services, paramedics and the fire brigade were pinned to their collar in terms of the challenges they were up against
The Minister will understand that response times are absolutely critical in order to achieve better outcomes
We would all agree with that
The National Ambulance Service came before the Joint Committee on Health last week, along with the Dublin Fire Brigade
They stated there are major challenges with staff retention across the board in the health service, along with capacity issues and issues that go back decades in terms of resources
They have stated that demand far outstrips supply
In a situation like that, there will be worse outcomes for people who need an ambulance at a particular time
That has to be addressed
The issues identified by the National Ambulance Service and the Dublin Fire Brigade have to be addressed because if we do not have capacity, people will die
When paramedics and the fire brigade reach an emergency department, there is another issue
The INMO, along with other unions, has stated that there are situations in emergency departments which are not conducive to patient safety or to staff safety
Unions have continuously told the Government that if it does not address these issues, people will die in emergency departments and staff will leave due to being demoralised and burned out
We will have an enormous problem because people with decades of experience will not continue working in that environment
That has to be addressed because otherwise we will be talking about this continuously
The INMO has said it will go as far as industrial action in the pursuance of staff safety in emergency departments and other hospital departments
It is crucial that we address these issues because if nurses' organisations such as the INMO are saying that they are finding themselves in unsafe situations and environments in hospitals, the alarm bells surely have to ring
We have to address staff retention and underlying issues of capacity
I have said this many times, and I will say it again: people go to emergency departments because they need medical help
People are waiting on trolleys for hours, and sometimes days, which is not acceptable
I do not know how anybody can find that acceptable
Ireland is a very wealthy country
People have paid tax all of their lives and when they need care at a particular time they have to wait days for it
That is completely dysfunctional and cannot be acceptable
I know the Minister does not accept people having to wait days for care
That is not an exaggeration; it is what has really happened to many people
People are waiting hours and days in emergency departments
In the time the Minister has left in this Administration, it is important that he addresses what the INMO has said about staff and patient safety
Deputy Boyd Barrett raised this issue at the Business Committee
It would be good if we had statements next week on safe staffing issues in Irish hospitals
The Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, has said the situation is not conducive to staff safety and patient safety
It would be in the public interest to have statements on that issue next week
The Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, will ballot its members on industrial action very soon
It is doing this in pursuance of safe staffing
It has repeatedly asked the Government to intervene to take pressure off the health system and its staff
Nurses in this environment have stated that it is very unsafe
Will the Government intervene, uphold and listen to the nurses’ union that this is not conducive to their staff or patients?

Before Christmas, I raised with the Tánaiste and the Government the issue of establishing a special committee on assisted dying
That was three months ago
The Government stated the committee would be established either before or after Christmas
Three months later the Government has not nominated any of its five members
There is a ridiculous situation where the chairperson of the committee, Deputy Michael Healy-Rae, and I mean no disrespect to him, has emailed all the Whips asking when the committee will be established
He wants to get the committee established as soon as possible
This is such a serious issue
Is the Tánaiste taking it seriously or not? I want to find out today when that committee will be established to examine this very serious issue
There needs to be a national discussion on it
That is a terrible answer
It shows complete disrespect for the idea
The Tánaiste did not even stand up
The Tánaiste did not stand up

In an emergency we need emergency measures
I do not think anybody is disputing that we are in a deep crisis with housing
The State must do everything in its power to stop people going into homelessness
As we have stated many times, more than 10,000 people are in this situation
The housing crisis is now in its second decade
Fine Gael has been in power for 12 years today
It is no coincidence that it has been part of the political landscape of the ongoing crisis
Lifting the eviction ban, whether in April or June, will start a process that will see thousands of people go into emergency accommodation
I will tell the Minister of State how bad the situation is with the local authorities at present
They are saying they do not have emergency accommodation for people becoming homeless
We could have a situation where hundreds and possibly thousands of families will have nowhere to go to shelter other than Garda stations
This is unacceptable
We have seen over recent decades that the situation is only getting worse
It comes down to ideology
I am sick of saying this
Nobody should find themselves in homelessness but this situation has continued unabated for the past number of decades
Relying on the free market and the neoliberal model of housing people with private developers has completely failed
There has to be a radical approach
I do not believe that Fine Gael is the political entity to deal with this crisis
It has had 12 years in power and it continues to exacerbate the crisis
There needs to be a change of government and a completely radical approach to housing our citizens
A report by the trade union Mandate showed that two thirds of retail workers are earning less than €400 per week
It also clearly showed that companies are actively choosing to bypass offering hours to existing staff to keep the employer's costs down
The union has called for legislative change to the Employment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2018
Will the Government review the Act and change the legislation to stop this practice?

Obviously, I welcome the establishment of the Citizens' Assembly on Drugs Use
It is a very important debate and probably the most important of this generation where drug use is concerned
Why it took three years in the lifetime of this Government beggars belief and why it has taken decades to come to this level of discussion also beggars belief
We have seen other models across the world where drug use and addiction are treated more holistically and with more empathy
By locking people up - and the majority of people in Irish prisons are there for some form of the drugs business - it shows the level of failure of the State's policy for those who are in the drugs industry
The majority of people in prison are there for that purpose
We have seen other models across the world such as that of Portugal
Those other models have saved lives
I have said many times in this Chamber that if it can save one life, then a change of policy is worthwhile
We cannot talk about decriminalisation without talking about regulation
Under decriminalisation, which is a much better model than the  Public opinion on this matter has shifted
In recent years, public opinion has moved beyond opinion in this House
A type of rot has set in whereby we keep the People take drugs through trauma
If people have problems with alcohol, we do not send them to prison
If people have a problem or a dependency on drugs, however, they are alienated and will be sent to prison
This is why I think the system is a failure
In the last 50 years, in the context of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977, when we look at the proliferation of all drugs, demand across the world has risen exponentially
It is impossible to stop the demand for drugs, their sale, etc
Even the President of Colombia, a country which has suffered terribly in recent decades from the narco wars, having lost hundreds of thousands of people, is saying, "Look, this policy just is not working anymore and we must do something different"
I believe other countries are now following suit to look at a different model
This model is decriminalisation
I must again emphasise regulation and looking at how we take control back from the mire of the black market
I say this because a small number of people have enriched themselves from this market, and through violence
It is incredible how much money they have and how powerful they are
The only way to undermine these people is to take control back
If we do not do this, then these people will always have control
We must, therefore, take control back
This is a wider argument, but hopefully we can have it over the next months and years
Will the Minister indicate his support for a public inquiry in relation to the death of Shane O'Farrell, which happened in August 2011? He was killed in a hit-and-run incident
Many of us would argue that death was completely unlawful and it could have been prevented
I would like to hear the Minister's opinion concerning the call from Shane's family and many of his supporters for a public inquiry into his death
I thank the Minister
Many of us have spoken about Shane O'Farrell, who was killed 12 years ago
He should be alive today, if it was not for the systemic failure of our judicial system regarding what happened on that day
Shane and his family continue to be failed concerning that fatal day
The injustice lingers
Not only does grief linger but also injustice in the context of that family calling for a public inquiry into Shane's death
The more I look back over and observe the last few years in respect of how the report from Judge Haughton has been dealt with, nothing but a public inquiry will do in respect of Shane's death
When will that report be brought to Cabinet? That is very important
Equally, how will it proceed after that? In 2019, both Houses passed a motion calling for a public inquiry
Before I came in, I looked at the definition of a "public inquiry"
There are four main points of a public inquiry: to establish the facts, to learn lessons, to restore public confidence and to determine accountability
Surely all these elements are relevant regarding the failures concerning what happened to Shane O'Farrell on that day
I appeal to the Minister and the Government to establish a public inquiry into the death of Shane O'Farrell
I do not think anything else could suffice concerning the situation the members of his family find themselves in
I have not seen the report, but nothing else will suffice now other than a public inquiry into Shane's death

Adult education tutors will organise a protest outside Leinster House today at 1 o'clock to demand improved terms and conditions for their job
They state they are not treated properly compared with other public servants
They have a number of issues around pay parity and the public services contract
This is a protracted set of circumstances
Last September, the Department of Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform put forward a proposal in regard to their situation
The workers want to know when this will be settled, when they will get pay parity with their colleagues and when they will be recognised as public servants
In today's edition of
I put it to the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, that while the Government has put in place welcome measures to mitigate the cost of living, they do not in any way go far enough
We can see this with energy costs and the cost of food and so on
This crisis impacts the least well-off in society who are on low incomes and fixed payments
When people must resort to food banks we have a huge problem
In any society, especially Ireland which is a very wealthy country, to have people resorting to food banks is a complete and utter failure of the Government
In times of crisis there are people who do very well
The best example would be the energy companies and the very wealthy in this State
The wealthy in this State have never had it so good
Energy companies have never had it so good
One does not have to be a Bolshevik to explain this
If there was ever a time for a windfall tax on energy companies, it is now
There should be no equivocation
These companies are making obscene amounts of money, yet people struggle to pay bills
I do not think anybody in the Government could defend this policy, but there seems to be equivocation from Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and, disappointingly, the Green Party
Even the Tories are now talking about windfall taxes on large companies that are making a vast amount of money
If we want to focus on something even more obscene, it is that the nine richest people in Ireland added €15 billion to their wealth during the pandemic
In the past 18 months, they have become even more wealthy
What does that say? The Government could introduce a wealth tax and bring money back to society for the common good
I do not think that is a hugely radical proposal
It is common sense
Working people are in a continuous economic survival mode in terms of obtaining decent pay, decent conditions, health services, education and so forth
That has always been the case
The fault lines were exposed, not only during the pandemic but during this crisis
Once there is an in-built social inequality and class system, there will always be inequalities whereby the wealthy do extremely well while the working people struggle
If people cannot live, they will resist
We have seen throughout history that when people cannot feed their children, they go on to the streets
When that happens, anything is possible
I ask the Minister to give that warning to the Government
People are extremely angry and frustrated
They literally cannot feed their families
I want to set out that this is no doubt quite a complicated issue, spans four or five decades and is somewhat opaque as to the interpretation of the care that should be given to our citizens
In this case we are talking about long-stay nursing home care
The central tenet to the critique the Attorney General has set out, and I and others would argue this point, is that those who had an obligation to receive care were subjected to an imposition of charges with regard to that care
That is, as I say, open to interpretation
Some families went to court and others did not and that was in respect of the resources of those families
There is no doubt that families went through very significant financial hardship in respect of those decades that have passed
It was policy to bring families through the courts and so be it
The report of the Attorney General, which I read this morning, and I do not generally read documents of that nature, says the Government’s position stands up legally, but I do not believe it stands up morally, where families were denied care that should be given to them
There has been a strategy by successive governments and by the Department of Health to counter litigation, and that could have a very detrimental effect on those families trying to seek justice and redress on this issue
Families were short-changed; of that there is no doubt
Also, however, in the public interest and in the public realm, society was also short-changed in respect of this entire issue, to say the least
Successive governments and Ministers have put compensation and redress at arm’s length, of which there is no doubt also
Looking at this objectively, families who should have been given this care and redress were made sweat and compensation was very difficult to obtain
We have seen wrongs in the State in how people were brought through the courts
To say the justice was arbitrary is an understatement
Were families let down? It is indisputable that they were
Whatever the Attorney General says, whatever successive Ministers have said, and whatever the Government says at the moment, families were let down in their time of need
When these families needed that help in respect of care, which is a simple obligation of the State, they were made pay both financially and in hardship terms
There are still a great number of questions in respect of this issue and families deserve those answers, not just over the next three months but over the lifetime of this Government
One of the Tánaiste's last engagements as Taoiseach was on 15 December in relation to the EU Council
Can he report back to the House on his engagement with his counterparts in relation to the common European defence?
I am glad the Tánaiste touched on the issue around EU battle groups
Does he not think that Ireland's participation in these groups undermines Ireland's neutrality? That is a very straight question
I refer to the EU battle groups which the Tánaiste has mentioned
Does this not erode Ireland's neutrality which has been a policy for decades? It has given huge credence to Ireland's international standing not to take part in any military exercise that is seen as, not defensive, but offensive
I read by this that any participation by Ireland in these groups in a breach of neutrality
I disagree with the Tánaiste
This is a flagrant breach of Ireland's neutrality
If you look at Ireland's participation even in the Nordic battle groups, the evolution can be seen and how Ireland is being pulled into more of a European defence army
Even on the commentary in the House in relation to eroding Ireland's triple lock status, the former Minister for Defence, Deputy Coveney, has said in the past that this is open for interpretation and debate
The soundings thus far, particularly in the last year, suggest Ireland's neutrality is being eroded
It is being eroded by stealth and by actual participation in these groups
These groups are not defensive; they are offensive
Looking at Ireland's participation in these groups, they are offensive, not defensive

My question relates to nursing home charges, which is an ongoing issue
I understand this goes back a number of decades and the information can be quite opaque, but it raises many questions regarding how the Department of Health and successive governments dealt with this issue
My question is valid and it is to be hoped the Taoiseach can answer it
There are issues in respect of families who were financially burdened with costs
Are there any outstanding liabilities that families and individuals have at present?
Financial liabilities to families that are going through the courts
According to this document, some €5 billion is-----
My question is the same
The programme for Government stated that there would be a citizens' assembly on drug use and the broader question of decriminalisation
We have waited and waited, but as of yet there has not been a date, which is disappointing
This issue has gone on for decades and the

We spoke about this issue on Thursday when there was an in-depth debate about the present situation in CAMHS
I said on Thursday and I will say again that the lack of clinical oversight was the main critique of the interim report by the Mental Health Commission
Without oversight, there will be serious issues in regard to everything relating to a service such as CAMHS
I acknowledge the work that the staff in CAMHS do
They do a very good job
It is a vital service for young people in distress
Recovery is possible once they get the proper intervention
Children and young people can recover from trauma and lead fulfilling lives
That is what we all want
The lack of clinical oversight is an indictment on the CHOs that run CAMHS
Alarm bells ring for anybody with an element of knowledge about this
When children are on anti-psychotic medication for years without oversight, there is something very wrong
The lack of clinical oversight leads to problems with retention and burnout of staff
They are only human beings
It also leads to underfunding
A good example of a service that should operate on full capacity is Linn Dara in Ballyfermot
Linn Dara is an amazing facility
It is a primary care inpatient centre for young people
However, every couple of years it has to close for a few months due to a lack of staff
That is a huge problem
It should not be closing under any circumstances
It has to close because it is extremely difficult to keep staff at the moment in our health service, particularly in CAMHS
How can we fix this? This is the most important thing
People are looking for solutions and do not want this to happen again
I hope the report, which will be finalised by the end of the year, will lay out why this happened and how it will not happen again
The report is so serious that it warrants an independent inquiry into how this was allowed to happen and the implications for children
Children may be looking in on this debate with their parents who will ask serious questions of services that they thought could be trusted to look after children in their time of need but they were not looked after to the best standards
Once that happens there is a breakdown of trust
There are serious consequences in regard to children’s mental health, families and so forth
I do not know the Minister of State’s stance on this but I believe the seriousness of the interim report means that an independent inquiry should be put together on its findings now or in the future when the report is finalised
I wish the Tánaiste well in his new role
In his role as Minister for Foreign Affairs in a neutral country, what does he intend to do to send the message of neutrality, especially regarding the conflict in Ukraine? As most people have seen, this is a brutal war carried out by a brutal regime
I will not mince my words
I do not believe that anyone minces their words in this Chamber
Putin is a war criminal
The crimes he has committed in the past year against the Ukrainian people are tantamount to war crimes; they are akin to what Nazi Germany did to most of Europe and Russia
He has caused untold suffering to the Ukrainian people
The resistance by the Ukrainian people has been heroic to the detriment of thousands, including Ukrainian and Russian soldiers
Putin is fixated on continuing this conflict
Alarm bells start ringing when I see NATO sending hundreds of tanks
I fear that this conflict could escalate into something that is uncontrollable
That means it could be NATO versus Russia, and that is a completely different kettle of fish
Looking at the past year and the evolution of this conflict, who knows where it will end
With continued escalation and more heavy weaponry, such as the tanks provided by the western alliance, someone somewhere will have to ask where we are going with this conflict
Is it escalation or de-escalation? All wars end but this war has the potential to escalate into a war that could go beyond the borders of Ukraine
When heavy weaponry is provided, as the US, Germany and France have done, one wonders how this war will end, where it will end, and the impact on Ireland's neutrality itself
Our neutrality has been questioned over the past year based on our stance towards Ukraine
One can look at Ireland's neutrality particularly in regard to Shannon Airport

I welcome this debate and the Mental Health Commission's interim report
It makes for very stark reading, to say the least
The issue of no clinical oversight is at the heart of the report
That is what it comes down to
That branches out to underfunding and understaffing, which is an indictment of mental health services for young people
Young people make up 25% of the population
That is the group that CAMHS provides a service to, yet that cohort of young people only get only 10% of the entire mental health budget
That is also an indictment
Some 90% of the budget is invested in adult services
We have spoken many times in this House regarding spending on mental health budgets
Sláintecare recommends 10% of the overall health budget
Currently, in this country, the figure is probably less than 7%
The WHO recommends 12% so we are well below European standards for overall spends on our mental health services
CAMHS would get five times more funding if expenditure on it was made equivalent to that for adult mental health
That is a fact
The report is so serious in respect of children's well-being that it warrants an independent inquiry
That inquiry should examine the funding and the staffing of CAMHS in both primary and secondary care
The report finds that staffing levels were to a point almost dangerous
Once there is lack of staff, mistakes will happen right across the board
Also important is the fact that when people are put under serious pressure there is burnout, lack of retention and demoralisation, and that seeps through an organisation
I acknowledge the amazing work those professionals who work in CAMHS provide
They provide an enormously important service
When children get the proper intervention at the proper time, the outcomes are hugely significant for those people
There is hope, positivity and a chance to recover
However, when there are situations such as those referred to in the report, situations which continue, the outcomes will not be very good
I wish to make a number of points as to what such an inquiry could look like
The prescribing rates and the pressure on parents to accept medication for their children are very important matters
The overprescribing of certain drugs is highly unethical
I am sorry, but no child should be on antipsychotic drugs for years
That leads to my next point, which is about the failure to provide alternative treatment
It is easy to give a child a medical intervention
There are circumstances where a child needs medical intervention via drugs, but not all the time, and that is very important in the context of the overprescribing of certain medications
The underfunding of CAMHS, to which I have alluded, is very important
That goes to the heart of the matter, as does the lack of inpatient CAMHS beds in primary care
Overall, the interim report is most serious in respect of children's health and well-being
If anything can come of the interim report and the issues to which it alludes, it is that they have to be addressed immediately
Otherwise, children - they could be our children or our nephews or nieces - will not get the treatment and intervention they need
Once that does not happen, we will fail all the children in respect of mental health services
The programme for Government states that a national director for mental health would be reinstated and would directly report to the CEO of the HSE
Given the gravity of the Mental Health Commission's report, the lack of clinical oversight and the repercussions for children, will the Minister of State consider reinstating this position in our health service?
Shame on you
Shame on the Deputy
On Tuesday last, the HSE addressed the Joint Committee on Health on the ongoing crisis in our emergency departments
As we know, hundreds of people have been left on trolleys in public hospitals
This is a perpetual crisis that happens every year and it is completely unacceptable in a country that is quite wealthy
This is obviously a legacy issue related to capacity, given that 40 years ago there were more beds in the public health system than there are now
This is why the crisis has been brewing
Emergency department consultants have said that people will die because of the trolley crisis
People will continue to die because of the lack of a plan
The winter plan is out the door; it is crisis management in relation to the HSE
Where does this lead us? It is not acceptable that those who have paid taxes throughout their lives and who rely on the public health system are left for days on trolleys
It is just not acceptable
A number of very important debates will happen next year
These debates are on very complex and quite difficult issues, but I believe these difficulties are not impossible to overcome
Successive governments have failed to address them in any meaningful way
These debates surround the issues of drug reform and end-of-life choices
During this week the Joint Committee on Justice published a report recommending a different approach to drugs for personal use
It is in the Government's power to change policy that will have a profound effect on all our citizens
To except the  This Government still resides over a two-tier health system
It is a system in which hundreds of thousands of people still have to wait for medical procedures and intervention and in which 50% of citizens still have to get private insurance
That is not a system that works
I do not believe this Government is capable of ending the inequalities in health and in our society
Today is largely cosmetic
It is a revolution we need, not a reshuffle
As we speak 35 children are being denied a drug because of the insatiable greed of a pharmaceutical company
Vertex, which is based in Ireland, is denying 35 children this vital drug
It has the Government and the HSE over a barrel
More importantly, it has the families over a barrel
This company has made billions of dollars in profits yet it is insatiable for more profits
Can the Minister give the families comfort over Christmas in regard to access to this drug? I understand the health technology assessment is going to be done but it could take up to six months before it is processed
These children do not have six months - it is as simple as that
These children need to be given access to this drug as soon as possible
It is morally wrong
It is corporate incompetence and it is corrupt that companies like this can have governments and families over a barrel
Does the Minister think privatisation of the energy sector has worked? Deregulation happened in the last 25 years
Deregulation and competition were supposed to drive prices down for electricity users but the opposite has happened in Ireland
We had the lowest electricity prices in Europe but now we have one of the highest so something has gone wrong
Private energy companies are doing very well and particularly in the last 18 months
France, which I know uses a lot of nuclear energy, has energy costs that are 50% below those in this State
The bigger question is around our natural resources, our wind energy and all that we have here and how it is being used
Is it for the common good or the good of profiteers? Private enterprise has tried to monopolise that and profit from it
It is not ethically right
We need these resources to be put in the public interest
On the proliferation of data centres, the State finds itself in extraordinary circumstances
In eight years, data centres will use up to 30% of all the electricity available in the State
It is incredible that this was allowed to happen because of corporate interests and profiteering
I get worried when the Minister starts to talk about blackouts and so on
Why would blackouts happen other than as a result of what the Minister has allowed to happen with data centres?
A constituent has contacted me about an unlicensed drug called Cariban, which is used to treat hyperemesis
Deputy Richmond raised this matter with the Minister of State yesterday
The situation with this drug is slightly unclear
This condition, as the Tánaiste will be aware, causes extreme vomiting in pregnancy and is dangerous for both the baby and the mother
In this year's budget, the Minister announced that the drug would be reimbursed and that is welcome
However, it is only reimbursed when prescribed by a consultant and not a GP
The condition generally begins in the first few weeks of pregnancy
Most women will only see a consultant after 12 weeks of pregnancy
The women who have contacted me, and probably other Deputies, say they want GPs to be allowed to prescribe the drug so that it becomes accessible and will be reimbursed more quickly than it is at present
I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for taking this important matter
The European Commission recently published a new study on breast cancer screening across the European Union
One of its recommendations was to extend breast cancer screening to include women from the ages of 45 to 74
As the Minister of State knows, in Ireland, the screening process begins at 50 and ends at 69
The European Union is saying that for better outcomes for women, the screening process age should be lowered to 45 and end at 74
The figures and evidence are quite compelling in respect of breast cancer in Irish women
One in nine million women will develop breast cancer over their lifetime
Recovery rates from the disease are high, which is important
The startling statistic, however, is that 23% of all women who are detected are under the age of 50
Between the ages of 20 and 50, the figure is 23%
Some 36% of the women who are diagnosed are over 70
Some 56% of women then are not in that screening process
The evidence is, therefore, quite compelling in respect of the lowering of the screening age for women
For example, in some European countries the age of screening starts at 45
Sweden, which is a good example, starts at 40
That country has found that when it started the process of screening at 40, there were 26% fewer deaths, which is a good result
The national screening advisory committee, NSAC, has stated that it will prioritise the proposal by the Commission
Will the Government take on the Commission’s report? Will it review the current screening process and, as women will ask for, will it lower the age of screening as per the recommendations of the Commission?
That sounds quite positive
This will take time and more resources
I was on the health committee where experts were brought in to talk about the pros and cons of extending the screening process
The case was quite compelling
It makes it less evasive
There is also an issue of women seeking early diagnosis
I know it can be lengthy and can run into years
For any cancer, early diagnosis and prognosis is important
The Commission's support for the new European Council recommendation is positive and I am glad NSAC has taken it on
There is compelling evidence for reducing the age to 45
If it saves one life, and if one person watching this is saved, it will be worth it
Anything is worth it if it saves one life
I am quite positive
There will be extra costs and resources but the Department of Health and the NSAC are willing to take that on and, hopefully, they will implement it as soon as possible
I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for taking this important matter
The European Commission recently published a new study on breast cancer screening across the European Union
One of its recommendations was to extend breast cancer screening to include women from the ages of 45 to 74
As the Minister of State knows, in Ireland, the screening process begins at 50 and ends at 69
The European Union is saying that for better outcomes for women, the screening process age should be lowered to 45 and end at 74
The figures and evidence are quite compelling in respect of breast cancer in Irish women
One in nine million women will develop breast cancer over their lifetime
Recovery rates from the disease are high, which is important
The startling statistic, however, is that 23% of all women who are detected are under the age of 50
Between the ages of 20 and 50, the figure is 23%
Some 36% of the women who are diagnosed are over 70
Some 56% of women then are not in that screening process
The evidence is, therefore, quite compelling in respect of the lowering of the screening age for women
For example, in some European countries the age of screening starts at 45
Sweden, which is a good example, starts at 40
That country has found that when it started the process of screening at 40, there were 26% fewer deaths, which is a good result
The national screening advisory committee, NSAC, has stated that it will prioritise the proposal by the Commission
Will the Government take on the Commission’s report? Will it review the current screening process and, as women will ask for, will it lower the age of screening as per the recommendations of the Commission?
That sounds quite positive
This will take time and more resources
I was on the health committee where experts were brought in to talk about the pros and cons of extending the screening process
The case was quite compelling
It makes it less evasive
There is also an issue of women seeking early diagnosis
I know it can be lengthy and can run into years
For any cancer, early diagnosis and prognosis is important
The Commission's support for the new European Council recommendation is positive and I am glad NSAC has taken it on
There is compelling evidence for reducing the age to 45
If it saves one life, and if one person watching this is saved, it will be worth it
Anything is worth it if it saves one life
I am quite positive
There will be extra costs and resources but the Department of Health and the NSAC are willing to take that on and, hopefully, they will implement it as soon as possible
The European Commission has called for a different approach to breast cancer detection
A key recommendation is to extend breast cancer screening to include women between the ages of 45 and 74
In Ireland the screening process for women is between the ages of 50 and 69
A total of 23% of all women who have been diagnosed with breast cancer are between the ages of 20 and 50
Will the Minister confirm that the Government will consider the recommendation of the European Commission to lower the screening age for breast cancer?
I welcome this legislation
It is long overdue
It is a lengthy Bill at more than 95 pages
I tried to read it but was limited in what I could take in
It is welcome that the Government is regulating an industry that has been largely out of control
Gambling is a big business and big business is gambling
It is worth an enormous amount, not only in Ireland but around the world, and is highly profitable
The problem that most people have with gambling is its insidious nature
We cannot watch any sport, particularly football at present, without seeing advertising relating to gambling
It is everywhere
The advertisements that come with gambling are pervasive and glamorous
To enjoy sporting activity, you have to have a bet on it
That is insidious in how people try to enjoy a sporting event that should be enjoyed
Online betting and gambling companies, however, have made it that people who do not have a stake in sport cannot enjoy it
That is the nature of online gambling
Some people will have problematic use of gambling, especially online gambling, because everybody has a mobile phone
It is so easy to make a bet
People do not have to go to a traditional betting shop
They do not have to do that anymore and need never go there again
They can bet a lot of money via apps on their phones
These have become prolific, to say the least
They are everywhere and people can bet on everything
Most people do not win
The real winners are gambling companies
As I said, it is profitable
There are certain weaknesses in the Bill around advertising
There should be a blanket ban on gambling companies advertising their industry
I have a major problem regarding how gambling is perceived, portrayed and conducted
There is nothing natural about gambling
People gamble and do not have a problem with it, but there has been very problematic use by those who could have a tendency towards that
There is also a socioeconomic factor to this
We find that people with problematic use come from a poorer socioeconomic background
That is where there are problems with losing one's wages, literally in seconds
That is also associated with gambling
It is welcome that there is finally something to put a stop to the current circus around gambling
Everybody will agree that there are huge issues with its proliferation and the way it is perceived
That is the issue we have to take in
Gambling companies have hijacked many sports
They put a significant amount into sport, for example, football clubs in England
In the second division there, half the clubs have advertising sponsorship related to online gambling
It is everywhere
As I said, it has to be reined in
There has to be regulation, including around how it is advertised and perceived and so forth
I welcome the Bill
As I said, there are certain weaknesses around advertising
The national lottery is another issue that needs to be addressed
The national lottery is gambling
Over time, particularly over the past five years, it has used a lot of advertising for purposes it was not set up for
If we look carefully at how the national lottery advertises itself, it has become more of a gambling entity rather than what it was set up to be
There was a weekly draw and people perceived that money went into the national lottery for good causes
That is largely not the case anymore
A lot of the surplus money from the national lottery is put into advertising to sell more products and gambling
It is all-pervasive
There needs to be regulation and it is to be hoped that this Bill, even though there are limits to it, can put a stop to this insidious behaviour that goes on in our society
It is almost two years since the death of George Nkencho in Clonee
George's family have been very patient regarding the investigation into his death, but they want to see the GSOC report as soon as possible
Can the Minister shed light on when the report will be published?
The family had this a year ago
They were told that the report would be finalised this time last year, but another year has passed
There were media reports that a draft investigation had been submitted to the commissioners but that report was in the media a number of months ago
Where is it? Has the report of the internal draft investigation been submitted? Has the Minister seen it? That is what the family want to know
The family want answers
They want the State to shine a light on the death of George Nkencho
Has the Minister seen the interim report that has been flagged in the media?
The circumstances surrounding the death of George Nkencho are extremely troubling, to say the least
George cannot be brought back, but the family want to know what the circumstances were that led to his death and that it will not happen to another family
That is the most important thing
The family want truth and justice
They want somebody to tell them this could have been prevented if something else had happened on that day
Whatever the GSOC recommendations, a public inquiry is needed in respect of George Nkencho's death
Anything less is an injustice to that family

I am disappointed that there is not a Minister with responsibility for the health portfolio here
It is not acceptable
We should have been notified before the debate
I am not blaming the Minister of State as I do not think he should be in this position, but we should have been told in advance that there would not be a Minister present
It makes a bit of a mockery of the debate really
The Chamber is empty as it is but to have no Minister for the brief or from the Department is a bit demoralising to say the least
I will soldier on because the issue of the two-tier health system is very important and we have had it for decades
There was a glimpse of what could and should be during the pandemic when we saw something that has not happened for a long time in this country: there was no such thing as a two-tier health system
How could a two-tier health system exist when up against the pandemic? The State took over 19 hospitals at huge expense given the vast amount of money that goes into private healthcare
We saw a glimpse of what could happen
I believe the vast majority of people would agree that we need a one-tier universal health system but we have a two-tier system
Once a system is in place where private healthcare competes against public healthcare and the kind of narrative exists where people tell themselves they will get better care if they have private healthcare, there will be inequalities
Once that system is put in place, there will be the terrible inequalities which happen on a daily basis
There are many people who have worked all their lives and ideologically they will not buy private health insurance on the basis of solidarity with other working people
They pay taxes yet they are second-tier citizens when it comes to healthcare
I think that system is wrong
I am sure the Minister of State agrees with universal healthcare
Everybody seems to agree with it but does not seem to do anything about it
Sláintecare, which is not perfect by any means, tries to address some of the inequalities but even it has its shortcomings
Around the world, including in Europe, countries that have universal healthcare have better outcomes for everybody whether you are on social welfare or are a millionaire
It has been proven that health outcomes, both mental and physical, and the health of the country, are better
When there is a system in which 50% of citizens rely on private health insurance, then you are going to have a system of inequality and of hierarchy
We do not have confidence in our public health service
I worked in the public health service
Once you are in it, it is brilliant
The people who work there, across a whole range of jobs, are absolutely incredible
Once you get into the system it is really good and everybody will say that
That is a good thing but there should not be vast resources going towards private healthcare
We need to get away from the model of a two-tier system
I am probably repeating myself with this mantra
Where will this all end? Sláintecare is trying to address some of the main inequalities
I am not so sure about that as a model
It has its shortcomings to say the least but this and successive Governments still promote the idea of private healthcare and stealth private healthcare
Once that exists in society, there will be inequalities
It exists in education and in the economic system and it is compounded by successive Governments which allowed it to happen
Once it is allowed to happen, there will be a "them" and "us"
In that system, people will suffer and die and people will go without
It is pretty heartwrenching to see somebody who has worked all his or her life, has paid all the taxes and did everything right being left on a trolley for three days
I swear to God, if it happened in any other country, there would have been a revolution
There would be a revolution because it is just not acceptable
People pay all those taxes and in their time of need they are told they have to wait in a corridor for three days
It is absolutely not acceptable
That is why ideologically People Before Profit is against a two-tier health system
We need universal healthcare
The NHS is not perfect by any means but it is revered in Britain, even more so than the royal family, because it does one thing: it is a national health system
From cradle to grave, generally it will look after you
There are obviously progressive elements in British society, but obviously the Tory party has been there for a long time and is not a beacon of progress and socialism but the NHS is a great model
It is a model we should try to copy because once you have a system that is based on equality, it will be a better system for everybody regardless of what you earn
I welcome the motion and the good work of Deputy Ó Ríordáin on this matter
He has a good track record in dealing with the issues surrounding drug reform, which is very welcome
Reading the motion, you do not know whether to cry in despair or keep your head up pushing for reform
It is a damning indictment of successive Governments that what has occurred has been allowed to happen
It is extremely sombre to consider that 10,000 people have died of drug-related causes over the past 25 years
These were people's brothers, sisters, mams, dads, other family members and friends
Addiction is very complicated and it can be messy
I am sure many of those people could still be alive today if there had been a different policy
I am sure of that
I had friends who definitely would be alive today if not for the marginalisation and social deprivation they experienced
When people experiencing addiction also experience the depths of despair, it is one way to hell
That is what individuals, families and communities have suffered
As I said, some of those who succumbed to addiction could still be alive today if there had been a different policy in place
I am 100% certain of that
If we look at different jurisdictions around the world, particularly Portugal, people are being saved
If we can save one life, it is worth changing the law
It is worth fighting for that
The Government has paid a great deal of lip service to having a health-led approach
That terminology is welcome but the question is whether it counters situations in which people find themselves, whereby they are criminalised, brought through the criminal justice system and marginalised
In fact, it simply does not work
The evidence shows we need a different kind of narrative around this issue
The availability of drugs since the 1970s has increased incrementally, not only in Ireland but across the world
The market for drugs is worth hundreds of billions of dollars every year
Our current laws, which originated 42 years ago, are not a deterrent against people taking or supplying drugs
More than 80% of the people in our prisons at this time are there for drug-related crime
They take in the whole pyramid of activity, from the very top to the very bottom
This tells us the current laws do not work
We need to do something different
We can talk about a health-led approach, harm reduction and all of that, but there needs to be a change
Attitudes in this country have changed dramatically
We need only look at what has happened in the past ten to 15 years in regard to women's right to choose and same-sex marriage
There have been social advancements in Ireland but, sometimes, this House has not moved on
People's attitudes to drug reform have changed
They do not see criminalising people for personal drug use as legitimate
There must be a different approach
This House is way behind public opinion on the issue
The days of prohibition and the Misuse of Drugs Act, which, as I said, is 42 years old, are coming to an end
We must do something very different and that starts with changing the laws around drug use
I do not know whether the Minister of State will still be in office in six weeks' time
We might have a new Minister of State
Policy in this area emanates from political choice
Why have successive Governments allowed what has happened to continue? Those Governments have largely been made up of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil
The question I always ask when considering the issues dealt with in the motion is why this has been allowed to happen
There are vested interests and so forth but, at the end of the day, there is no political will or courage to change what is happening
This is largely affecting working-class communities
The vast majority of people who have died are from certain postcodes in Dublin and certain areas elsewhere in the country
They are largely working-class people
If this was happening to people in a different postcode in Dublin, there would be a completely different response
If we do not have political will on this issue, people do not have a voice
Those who have succumbed to all this horribleness around addiction have been let down by successive Governments and a lack of political will
That can be changed and the change can be achieved in this House
We need political will from the Government to say that this can no longer continue and something very different must be done
We need to look at other countries that are changing their models around drug reform
After decades of doing things that do not work, they have recognised there must be a changed approach
Countries in Europe are changing their policies, as are the US, Canada, countries in Asia and even countries in South America, which have been terribly affected by drug wars
They have realised the  We must do something
The days of the Misuse of Drugs Act are coming to an end
It may take another couple of years to make a real change but we must look upon the past four or five decades as an absolute failure
If we act now, future generations will say that at least the current generation did something about the madness that happened in the previous four decades
My question is on the interim report by the independent review group on sexual abuse in the Defence Forces
This is the most serious of matters
The Women of Honour group has brought this to the attention not only of the Army but also the State
It wants an update on the interim report, which the Minister has probably seen
As the Minister noted, these allegations are of the utmost seriousness in regard to our Defence Forces
There is a frustration in respect of the interim report
The Women of Honour, who have made these allegations, would like to see that interim report and I think they have every justification in that regard
My understanding is that a number of other victims have come forward in the meantime to make allegations of the most serious nature against individuals in the Defence Forces
It is imperative for the process to proceed with confidence that the women see this interim report, where it is going and whether it is going in the direction they would like
We want accountability and justice for the women who have been subjected to this awful conduct in the Defence Forces
From the outset, there have been issues with the terms of reference of the review
I understand that witnesses cannot be compelled, so there is something of a failure in that regard
If the Women of Honour, at this juncture, do not have full confidence in the review group and its interim report, that sets alarm bells ringing
The people who have made these allegations will not be included in the interim report, and that could lead to a failure
I acknowledge that the Minister said this is neither the beginning nor the end of the process but rather that it is a process that seeks accountability for the grave actions these women were subjected to
It is important, therefore, for the Women of Honour to be given confidence and transparency in respect of a report that is ultimately about them
It is about what happened to them and their peer group, so it is important they have confidence in the process

Yesterday, with other Deputies, I attended the launch of the "Final Report – Scoping Inquiry into the CervicalCheck Screening Programme" by Dr
Gabriel Scally
It was an uplifting briefing but it was also sombre
One could not help thinking of all the women who should have been here today had it not been for the systemic failures in the cervical cancer screening programme
A number of issues arose on the recommendations, namely, capacity and there being none and the Coombe hospital is trying to fill that gap; outsourcing, most of which is going to the United States; and also language which is very important with the question of "should" or "must" in relation to disclosure
Is the Government committed to all the women who should have been here who are not because of this awful part of our history?
I move:That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 to enable a person who is at least 18 years of age to have possession, for the person’s personal use, of either or both cannabis and cannabis resin that in each case does not exceed a specified amount and to provide for related matters
I am thankful that I am introducing this Bill today
It has been a number of years in the making
The last Bill which came before the House on this was ten years ago
I think Ireland has moved on considerably since then
Ireland is a very different place in relation to many things and it is a different place in the area of drug reform
The Bill is quite moderate
It amends existing legislation that dates back 42 years
Forty-two years is a very long time
I believe the existing legislation is out of date and out of time
We need a different narrative around drug reform
Criminalising people for possession of small quantities of any drug, and particularly cannabis, is a complete waste of time
It is a waste of resources
Bringing people through the criminal justice system does not work
There are different models
We need to use a model that stops criminalising people who are adults and make adult choices
Criminalising people for drug use does not work and we need something very different
Ironically, all drugs in schedule A are controlled drugs
That means that the only people who are allowed to have them is the State
Instead, we have the opposite
The cannabis market is controlled by organised crime
Why allow that to happen? Why keep allowing that to happen? We need to take back control and stop criminalising people
There is a debate to be had
I think there is a groundswell of opinion not only in Ireland but across the world for something very different
We need to move away from the status quo because it does not work
It has not been a deterrent
The legislation we have now is meant to deter people from possessing, selling or cultivating cannabis but it has done the opposite
It has driven it underground and has made it largely controlled by the black market
A better system is one that is controlled by the State
It is a system that is best for everybody whether one uses cannabis or not
Whether or not one uses cannabis is irrelevant
We are looking at a societal issue here
The Government has talked about a harm reduction, health-led approach which is welcome but it is rhetoric
It is lip service at the end of the day
If the Government believes in a health-led approach then it would have to support this Bill
If it does not support this Bill then I do not see meaning in what the Government says about harm reduction
Surely, if it supports the idea of decriminalisation and a health-led approach it would support this Bill
There will be a wider debate around this issue in the citizens' assembly
That is very welcome
We need to have a grown-up discussion about drug use in this country because for too long people were criminalised and marginalised
That is the one thing that you do not do to people
It has never worked
Giving people criminal convictions for small amounts of cannabis that follows them around forever is barbaric
In years to come they will look at our legislation on drug use and wonder how stupid were the people who put in place these antiquated laws to criminalise people because of things that happen in life
I hope the Government can support this legislation
It is timely
Different parts of the world are looking at different models which do not criminalise people and which take a harm-reduction approach
I look forward to the debate
We need a mature discussion on this
History is on our back
We have had 40 years of bad law
It is time to change the laws and make them good for everybody
I move: "That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time
A year and a half ago, the Joint Committee on Justice recommended a special committee on the issue of assisted dying
To my knowledge, there is no impediment to the establishment of that committee
Can the Taoiseach give a commitment to the many people who have been following this issue that the committee will be established before Christmas because it has gone on far too long? We need to have a national discussion about this issue
I wish to share time with Deputy Bríd Smith
We will see how it goes
I welcome the motion tabled by the Rural Independent Group
It is a good motion which touches on many issues concerning energy
One of the issues I wish to reference relates to the proliferation of data centres in the country
I refer specifically to the South Dublin County Council area where, currently, there are close to 50 data centres
It has the highest concentration of data centres in the country
The facts are stark in regard to data centres not only in this county council area but elsewhere in the State
Currently, data centres use 14% to 15% of all electricity demand but in eight years' time, that will increase to 30%
It is an incredibly stark figure when we think that one third of electricity demand will come from one type of entity in the State, namely, data centres
We are not against data centres With the help of my party colleague Councillor Madeleine Johansson, South Dublin County Council voted to put a moratorium on all data centres in the council area between now and 2028
That vote has been overturned by the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, which is completely wrong
It is against local democracy
Councillors should have a say
They should have a voice with respect to data centres being concentrated in their area
The facts are incredible
Around the world, data centres typically account for up to 3% or 4% of electricity demand
As I said, in Ireland it is 15% and growing
What could happen is that, because data centres are using so much of the resource, a sudden shock in demand will cause households to be in the dark
There is such a concentration of electricity for data centres and it is not sustainable
As a member of the Green Party, surely the Minister of State agrees this is not a sustainable model of electricity supply and demand? I ask him to relay to his Government colleagues that local democracy should be upheld
There should be a moratorium on all data centres, not only in South Dublin County Council but in the State as a whole
My question is on the shortage of secondary school places
I can speak for Clondalkin in the constituency I represent, Dublin Mid-West
The shortage is so acute at the moment that a number of schools have large waiting lists of 50, 60 or 70 students
What normally happens is that most students will find a school in their vicinity
In the academic year starting next September, though, students will not be able to find a place in the area whatsoever
Children not having a place is not acceptable
This is an issue of capacity and resources, but how can the Taoiseach put parents' minds at ease about students having places come next September?
We all knew that this day would come
Her family and close friends knew that this day would come
Vicky herself knew, deep down, that this day would come
We took Vicky into our collective hearts and now all our hearts are broken
I got to know Vicky a number of years ago in relation to the issue around assisted dying and she was vocal about that issue
She said to us that no matter what the circumstances, you need to pledge to keep supporting and campaigning for the issue around assisted dying
Her other wish was that the cervical screening programme not be outsourced and that it be brought home
That wish needs to be honoured
We owe it to her memory and her family
Our condolences go to Jim, Darragh and Amelia
We all know that there are enormous challenges in our emergency departments currently
Recently, the
I wish to express my solidarity with the tech workers this week with regard to the possible layoffs in the tech sector
The last week has shown that tech companies are quite ambiguous about employment laws in Ireland
There are penalties for breaching employment law in respect of notice of redundancy
Has the Tánaiste made the tech companies aware of this law and the penalties for breaching employment law around redundancies?
I commend the Regional Group and Deputy Naughten for his continued work on long Covid
We are three years into this pandemic
The world did not know the term "Covid-19" until three years ago
Since then, this virus has claimed millions of lives, affected hundreds of millions of people and caused economic chaos across the world
Many of us who got Covid-19 have recovered fully, thankfully
A vaccine has been developed which has been hugely helpful in the fight against the pandemic
A whole cohort of people who got Covid-19 in the last three years, however, have not recovered fully
As a member of the Joint Committee on Health, Professor Jack Lambert's critique of long Covid was a revelation to me and many others on the committee
In my naivety, I thought the symptoms of Covid-19 were mostly respiratory
As Professor Lambert said, cognitive and neurological symptoms can also be devastating to those who have long Covid and continue to suffer these symptoms
The most important aspect of this debate is that people in this situation must be listened to and supported
This is the main thing in this debate
For too long those with illnesses such as fibromyalgia, myalgic encephalomyelitis, ME, or Lyme disease have been largely dismissed as having something that is largely in their own heads and been told they should just get on with things
Obviously, this is not the case by any means
In his critique, Professor Lambert laid out in bare terms that people are suffering physically and mentally in this regard
I got Covid-19 about four months ago
Physically it takes its toll, but I cannot imagine dealing with those symptoms continuously for months on end
It must be most distressing on those who are in that situation
For those who have long Covid, the main issue is support
There is hope
People who have long Covid do get better
However, there is a cohort of people for whom it lingers
That can be detrimental, not only to their physical health but also financially
They cannot go back to work and that is a significant impediment on their financial circumstances
Not classifying Covid-19 as an occupational injury was a huge mistake by the Government
This should be an occupational injury
If one works in a medical setting - for example, if one is a nurse or doctor - one can get time off, etc
, but if one is in a different setting, such as an educational setting, it can be much more problematic
If there is something to come out of this debate - the Government has put these specialist clinics forward - it must be that there is quite a lengthy waiting period to see a specialist
The average waiting time is ten months
Given the situation, it is not good enough
If we listen to and support these people, the situation will be much better for those who are experiencing long Covid
I welcome this good motion on home care
It is a good critique of where we are at the moment
There is no argument, here or outside here, but that older people are better off being cared for at home
I have experienced that as a care worker myself and in the past six or seven months of my mother's life when she was cared for at home
Home is where our parents want to be
It is where they grew up, where their family and friends are and it is the best environment, sometimes, for end-of-life care
Sometimes it is not conducive but it is the best place for our loved ones to be at that particular time
It is better in financial terms because if a person is in hospital for a week, it adds up to approximately €6,000
If a person is in a nursing home, it costs €1,000 per week and, therefore it makes a lot of financial sense to have somebody in that situation in their home
Then there is the matter of age demographics
In the next seven or eight years there will be many more people aged over 65
Whether they need that care will depend on their own situation but demographics will play a part in how we provide for our older citizens
I understand considerable time has been given to home care hours in the past five to ten years but we have to look at where these hours are going and the private companies involved in private home care work
Probably the best example of the whole structure of this, which the Minister of State referred to in her statement, is how much private companies charge the HSE per hour
If we break this down it does not make sense
The worker who does all the work is getting paid €11
50 or €12 per hour and the company is charging €28 per hour
Somebody is making a lot of money out of this
If we look at what the main private operators got in 2020, it is eye-watering
In 2020, three companies got the following from the HSE: Home Instead Senior Care, €58 million; Bluebird Care, €33 million; and Irish HomeCare, €13 million
I am sure that has gone up incrementally in the past two years
It would be better to put resources into a public system where workers are looked after properly
The private sector is haemorrhaging workers because they are not looked after
If the company is getting that amount, it is hugely profitable but, at the same time, workers are not even paid to travel from A to B
If they are not getting paid for that, then it is no wonder people are leaving the sector
There is also a good angle to this
I worked for the HSE directly and it was a better rate of pay
The executive looked after its workers and that is a better system, considering the huge resources that go into this
It is better for the worker, the person they are going to, the family, society, the taxpayer and everybody
It is not about looking to the private model all the time because that system is not conducive to home care and proper care in the home
There is something extremely dysfunctional about housing supply and policy in this country
The policy can be traced back decades
It is one of commodification of shelter
That is the heart of this debate about the crisis of homelessness
Corporate bodies saw that ideology and they saw bricks and mortar as something to invest and speculate in and get very rich on
They did this not only in Ireland but across the world
Politically, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil bought into that ideology as well
Big developers bought into it and they brought it into Fianna Fáil as well
The amount of donations that were given to Fianna Fáil over the last 25 years runs into millions of euro
That tells us something about the heart of dysfunction in the housing market
People have to go without a home and go into emergency accommodation
Over 10,000 people in this country are in that situation at this moment
It is absolutely incredible that the situation is getting worse rather that better
That ideology was one of looking to the free market and not to public or affordable housing
To its credit, Fianna Fáil in the 1950s and 1960s had a very good policy on public housing
Many housing estates in Dublin and across the country were built by the Minister's party
It believed in public housing and social housing
It believed in communities
The ideology of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael is one of the free market and commodification of shelter
This has only been compounded by Fine Gael, which has been in power since 2011
That is 11 years of power in the context of its policy
That has only compounded the issue
Until we change the ideology and ultimately the Government, the housing crisis will get worse and worse
I was out canvassing a number of days ago and two young people, teenagers, asked me a very pertinent question
They asked me why is there homelessness in this country
I was not struck by the question but by the level of passion in their voices
Why are there some many people homeless in this country? I tried to answer that as well as I could
In that situation young people, and there are many young people here, ask themselves
They may be in a house at the moment or maybe not
They will ask themselves why politicians cannot for once sort out the problem of sheltering our citizens
It is the biggest question and issue of our time
Politicians on the Minister's side of the House cannot fix it
That is the question here
They cannot fix it
What is wrong? There is an answer and a solution to every problem
There should never be people homeless in this country at all
Once we go with the ideology of the commodification of shelter, unfortunately there are going to be tens of thousands of people in the future in the situation of being homeless
Two years ago today this House voted by 81 votes to 71 votes to progress the Dying with Dignity Bill
Since then, progress on the issue has stalled
I believe this is a derogation of this substantial issue
It is imperative that the recommendation made by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice to establish a special Oireachtas committee to examine the issue is constituted as soon as possible
It is important
The indication is that the Irish public would support a change in the law around assisted dying
When will the Government commit to a special Oireachtas committee to give us, and more importantly to give the public, a chance to examine the issue of assisted dying?
The Department of Health announced six specialist menopause clinics in recent weeks
This is very welcome in standardising women's health in Ireland
There is an issue with staffing but it is to be hoped that can be overcome
The issue I have been contacted about by a number of women in my constituency is in regard to the price
If a person does not have a medical card, he or she will have to pay an initial charge of €150 and €75 thereafter
We have been speaking about universal healthcare and about Sláintecare
People who do not have a medical card are burdened with that price
Can this be reviewed in the future in order that people can access this healthcare for free?
In the Government's lifetime, will it conduct a review of all Covid deaths in nursing homes during the pandemic, in particular during the first 14 to 15 months? More than 53% of all deaths took place in that environment
I would like a public inquiry into this matter
We all agree that fundamental mistakes were made during this period
What happened in the pandemic was unprecedented in Ireland and across the world
We had never seen it before in our lifetime
What the relatives want and deserve to know is what happened to their family members in their final weeks or days
I just cannot comprehend a situation in which one's mother or father is in a nursing home and there is no access for loved ones
There was panic in some instances
That situation warrants a robust inquiry or whatever the Minister wants to call it, whether a public inquiry or a review
A public inquiry is warranted in respect of the factors that led to so many deaths taking place in a nursing home environment
That is the question at hand
We can call the investigation whatever we want
I acknowledge inquiries have a bad history in this country in that they have been completely dragged out in the past
However, the relatives of those who died at least deserve some answers
I agree with the Minister that we do not want a dragged out process where, at the end of the day, it is the barristers and solicitors who are enriched
The special Oireachtas committee on this issue recommended that a public inquiry take place
That committee had a lot of respect and was thorough in its investigation of events, particularly in the first 14 months
The other question that has to be answered concerns the composition of nursing homes in Ireland
Twenty years ago, they were 80% public but that is now reversed
The composition is unhealthy
It would seem private nursing homes were not equipped for this outbreak
The pandemic killed more than 1,000 people in the first 14 months in that environment
Systematic mistakes were made in regard to all the deaths that took place

A number of parents are listening to this debate
What they will want to know is when their children will get access to the drug Kaftrio
There are 35 children being denied a drug that is hugely beneficial to treat their cystic fibrosis, CF
They will be asking questions of the HSE and the manufacturer, Vertex
A resolution has to be found immediately
It is unbelievable that others living with CF have access to this drug
It is hugely beneficial
Even in Europe, the vast majority of people living with cystic fibrosis have access to it
These parents and children are being denied and delayed
That is a terrible injustice for these children
I understand the Minister for Health will be meeting with some of the parents next week regarding this cohort of children
It is disappointing that the meeting has not taken place thus far
There is huge frustration and anger about this situation
I always try to put myself in the shoes of a parent of a child with CF
Imagine knowing there is a medication that is being denied to your child
That is immoral
I am sure the Minister of State and everybody else will agree with that, given that a drug is available to people but these children cannot get it because of what seems to be a price dispute between the HSE and Vertex
A resolution has to be found
No financial burden should be put on parents and children at this stage
There is speculation that this could be referred to the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics, NCPE
That is an arduous and lengthy process, to say the least, that could go on for well beyond three months
Time is of the essence for access to Kaftrio
I hope the Minister of State will have some news today for the 35 parents who are listening and seeking access for their children
I do not blame the Minister of State, but if I was a parent of a child listening to this, I would believe the fault lies with the manufacturer, Vertex
That is not disputable
It is also not disputable that Vertex is a multi-billion dollar enterprise, so much so that I looked up its listings on how much it makes per year
To say it is eye-watering is an understatement
It has a stock valuation of $70 billion
Its turnover two years ago just for the drug Kaftrio was $5
7 billion
Two years ago, it made a profit of $4
3 billion
It is incredible the amount that a pharmaceutical company can make and at the same time go into a dispute with, and almost blackmail, governments around the access to this drug
It is absolutely immoral that pharmaceutical companies, most of which are based in Ireland, have governments and families over a barrel
They make an amazing profit, but the Minister of State said in her statement that they are looking for extra funding
I am sure they have done very well out of the Irish State just with this particular drug
They have made tens of millions of euro in profits but they will not compromise on this issue
The Minister of State must agree that it is absolutely immoral
I do not know how these people sleep at night while at the same time children are being denied this drug
In one guise Kaftrio is being hailed as the closest thing to a cure for those with CF, yet this is being denied to children
It is absolutely immoral
Hopefully, the Minister can convey this sentiment to the CEO of Vertex

I have just come from a very lively protest at Liffey Valley Shopping Centre
This protest was called by shop workers who are protesting against the imposition of car-parking charges for staff
These charges will be up to €600 per year
The staff feel aggrieved about this, given all of their hours and years of hard work at the shopping centre
To add insult to injury, yesterday Liffey Valley Shopping Centre announced that customers will be free for one month if they register their details, yet the staff who make all the profits for the shopping centre are charged €2
50 and more per day
Does the Taoiseach think this is fair in light of the National Transport Authority's proposal that it would have walking, cycling and public transport infrastructure in place, yet it has not? It is months away
It is an absolute disgrace that during a cost-of-living crisis, workers are paying to go to work
Yes, there are
Perhaps the Taoiseach could have a word
There is a very real threat to the health system in the coming months
The possibility of twindemic between Covid and flu has the potential to overwhelm emergency departments and hospitals
At the moment, there are 500 people on trolleys in emergency departments, including a number of family members of mine whose experience was criminal - criminal that people who have worked all their lives are treated that way
People in the HSE should be in prison for the treatment of some of the people who are seen in emergency departments
It is not the staff who are at fault but the HSE and the Government in terms of how people are treated in emergency departments
The Government announced the winter plan this week
I think it is a by-word for crisis management
Does the Tánaiste have confidence in that plan and the health system to treat people decently?
These are people who were waiting three days for a bed
It is absolutely laughable
I again raise the issue of the Covid-19 pandemic recognition payment
There was much fanfare about this payment and we all supported it but many workers have not received it
They include many care assistants who work in the private sector
They were outside the Department of Health today and issued 1,700 individual letters to that Department on the non-payment of this
It is shambolic
Deputies get €1,000 because of the budget and front-line workers who were protecting our mothers, fathers, brothers and sisters still have not received that payment
It is an absolute embarrassment
Will the Taoiseach intervene personally to say these workers will get the payment as soon as possible?
Care assistants, front-line workers
Everybody was clapping them six months or a year ago and now they get nothing
It is shambolic
This Government and previous Governments have failed to grasp the winds of change in drug reform
When other states are changing course, I would argue that this State has stagnated in drug reform
In the past 20 years 10,000 people in this State have died of drug-related deaths, which is an incredible statistic
That is 500 people every year in the State
I would argue that if these people had different postal addresses and codes, the response from this Government and previous Governments would have been very different
We are in an unsustainable situation and the amount of resources that go into criminalising people for drug use does not work
Even US President Joe Biden made an announcement last week on reform in the US policy on cannabis use and so forth, and that is welcome, but in this State we criminalise people for using drugs
The majority of people in the prison population are there for drug offences
The resources that go into criminalising people simply do not work and we need to do something very different

My question relates to the murder of a seven-year-old boy named Rayyan Suleiman who was chased to his death by the Israeli army
Has the Minister spoken to the Israeli ambassador in Ireland in respect of that murder and the countless others that have occurred in the past year?
I have here a photograph of Rayyan Suleiman
He was a seven-year-old boy whose only crime was being Palestinian
That was his crime
The Israeli army took that young boy from his family
He is not the only one
Some 20 children have this year been killed by the Israeli army
The Minister does not have to listen to me
He can listen to former United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Ms Michelle Bachelet, who said that Israel on a constant basis is breaking international law and is combining that with an almost total lack of accountability
This comes down to that lack of accountability for the Israeli army and state
What did the Minister say to the Israeli ambassador about this killing and the countless others?
What the Minister has said is all well and good but Israel is not a normal state
This year alone, 100 Palestinians have been killed by excessive force and collective punishment by the Israel Defense Forces
As I said, 20 children were among the dead
This is a policy that runs through the Israeli state to crush any Palestinian resistance
That is how states such as Israel exist and continue
They have to use excessive violence to exist
When Palestinians fight back, whether armed or peacefully, they cannot be blamed
They cannot be blamed for fighting back when children are being murdered on a daily basis
What does the Minister say to the Israeli ambassador when this happens? How does he address it at a European level?

I wish to share time with Deputies Boyd Barrett and Barry
I welcome this very important motion on free transport
I think there is a very valid argument in regard to public transport being free, accessible and of top quality
All the evidence suggests that where we have such a system, people will use it
I always remember going to Europe for the very first time and being amazed by the system of public transport
It was the thing that stood out most to me when I went to parts of Europe, in particular the accessibility and the fact it was relatively cheap
It got even better when I went east to the ex-communist countries and although they had their faults, their transport was pretty unbelievable for countries like that
There are many valid reasons we should have free public transport and one of the main reasons is around environmental issues
Capitalism has relied on the car culture
We only have to look at the M50 and many other places in Ireland where there is complete dominance of cars
That is not environmentally sustainable
If we build and give people an option or an alternative to cars, they will use it
As I said, all the evidence points that way
The privatisation of certain services in Dublin has been an unmitigated disaster
With Go-Ahead Ireland, a company that runs certain services in Dublin mid-west, buses are not even showing up for two or three hours
Imagine how frustrating it is if you are waiting for a bus to go to work but it never comes, so you have to pay €25 for a taxi to get to work, and when you are coming back from work, there is no bus again
These services need to be taken back into public hands
A model of free transport with connectivity and accessibility is important
It has been put in place around Europe so that getting a bus, train or any other form of public transport, except taxis of course, is free
Where free transport is accessible, people will use it
Once people start doing that, there will be fewer cars on the road, which would be a very good thing
Over the weekend at the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis, the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, claimed that health service waiting lists have been stabilised
The reality is very different
The reality is that more than 900,000 people at present are on some form of public health or hospital waiting list, which is completely unacceptable
Can the Taoiseach justify what the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, said given the reality of people waiting for simple medical procedures?
I want to raise an issue regarding the shortage of public health nurses in early childhood development
These are vital services for new mothers
Several parents have contacted me and other Deputies in Dublin Mid-West to inform us there are no public health nurses whatsoever
They have been told by the HSE that they will not have one for at least 18 months
This is completely unacceptable
The problem is acute, not only in Dublin
Of the 240 public health nurse vacancies, 62% are in Dublin
The services are vital but parents cannot avail of them
What is the Government doing to address these issues? The issues pertain to something that goes further than vacancies because nurses just will not take up the positions because of the cost of rent and the cost of living
I want to acknowledge the work done by the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, and the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, on the issues they have acknowledged in their speeches
It is welcome that there is progress on those issues
I want to start on a positive note because sometimes there is a lot of negativity around here
I will get to the negative part later
A lot of money was splashed out in yesterday's budget
In my time here, this is an unprecedented financial intervention by the Government
It is warranted because we are facing a cost-of-living crisis the likes of which we have not seen for a number of decades
When working people see their standards of living going down rather than up, then we have a serious issue
The cost of living has shaped this budget, and it will probably shape the next one because these inflationary issues will not go away
There are external and internal factors
There are also people profiteering from this crisis, including the energy companies and companies such as big supermarkets and retail companies that are making vast amounts of money on foot of the ongoing crisis
The fundamentals of the issues at hand are still real and that is what shaped the last general election two and a half years ago
The reasons that people rejected Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil come down to issues relating to public services, namely, housing and health, and income inequality
They were the fundamentals that still exist to this day and that is why people are listening today and yesterday to hear what effects the budget will have on their lives
A great deal of money has been passed around and that will trickle down, but the big question is whether it will have an effect on people's livelihoods or mitigate the cost-of-living crisis, which is the idea
There is a big question mark around that because there are major shocks on the horizon in people's livelihoods in heat, food and so forth
Questions have to be asked in that regard
On the Minister for Health's contribution to the debate, I welcome the progress made on hospital charges and GP visits, which is very good
Nobody has said this but the overall health budget has gone down relative to inflation
The mental health budget is 5% while Sláintecare has always stated that it should be 10% and again that has not kept up with inflationary pressures
Inflationary pressures are at least 9% so that is a cut
Most workers in the State are taking a pay cut of up to €2,000, which is unsustainable inflation
There are welcome factors in this budget and there are also the fundamentals that are still not being challenged
They have to be seriously addressed, particularly housing
It is unacceptable that 10,000 people and more are in emergency accommodation
Even if we had €120 billion, having 11,000 people in emergency accommodation is completely unacceptable and in other countries the Government would be expelled completely and there would be a general election
There are huge issues, particularly for working people who feel poorer than they did last year
Will this mitigate the decline in their standard of living? There are big question marks in respect of that matter
Earlier this year, the Government announced a pandemic recognition payment, broadly welcomed by this House, for front-line workers who worked during the pandemic
However, a whole section of workers have not received this payment
They are largely HSE staff but they also include section 39 voluntary workers, members of the fire brigade and workers in private nursing homes
They have not got the pandemic payment, which is quite incredible after nine months
What gets even more bizarre is there is now a tendering process for the administration relating to those who have not received the payment
There is to be a situation where a tendering company will probably end up getting more money than the people who were trying to protect us
That is bizarre to say the least
I would like to hear the Minister's comments on that
I am sharing time with Deputy Boyd Barrett
We welcome and support this Bill
It is amazing to think that the Brexit referendum, which led to many anomalies, happened six and a half years ago
As a consequence of Brexit, there has been a correction in regard to medical interns studying in Britain or the North of Ireland to come back here
That is a good thing
If we can attract professionals back into the Irish health system, it is a good thing
There is also a downside to this
I am probably preaching to the converted because the Minister of State knows the downside with regard to keeping people in the Irish public health system, which is the most important thing
If graduate doctors, nurses and other allied professionals who are qualified at the highest grade in the world feel compelled to leave the country at the end of that process, we have a big problem
We have to challenge that
At the moment, there is an enormous number of vacancies
For example, there are vacancies for 900 medical consultants
Such a void has consequences in regard to healthcare
Other Deputies alluded to the junior doctors who issued an extraordinary statement a number of months ago regarding their conditions
If doctors are saying that their working conditions in certain environments are unsafe, we should be concerned not only in regard to their own well-being but also patients’ well-being
We are talking about life and death in some circumstances
If they say these circumstances are extremely stressful and detrimental to the profession, this is a serious problem
Like many other Deputies, I have said on several occasions that this issue has to be addressed immediately
That is down to retention, recruitment and respect in regard to workers who have graduated and want to play their part, but circumstances go against them
I would like to refer to a statement that Dr
Fergal Hickey, who is the president of the Irish Association for Emergency Medicine, made on a radio show yesterday
He painted a stark picture of emergency departments this year and beyond
He stated that we need a plan for the whole year, and not just a winter plan, for sudden surges of influenza or Covid-19
The Irish health system is not prepared for any sudden shocks
It seems we were lucky a year and a half ago in regard to Covid-19
If there had been a situation where there was an absolute oversurge in relation to emergency beds and acute beds, the Irish health system would have been in serious trouble
Happily, that did not happen but it is still a possibility
My final comment relates to overall recruitment, retention and respect
There are a number of reasons people stay in a country or in a job
People are motivated to help their fellow human beings in the health system
That is why they go into healthcare jobs, and stay in them, but there is a huge issue in regard to staff retention
The reasons that people leave the Irish health service have to be addressed
They are passionate about their jobs but they look at the related issues of cost of living and burnout
I have friends who are nurses in the Irish health system
They are motivated but find it difficult to stay in the system, particularly due to the cost of living
It is detrimental to the Irish health system if we cannot keep these people
If we cannot keep them, other health systems get them, to the detriment of Irish society
We cannot afford to lose people like that
We must recruit them, look after them, respect them and retain them
I will ask the same question
The pandemic recognition payment was broadly welcomed, but it is ludicrous that workers who do not work directly for the HSE have still not received their payments
The goodwill that greeted the bonus has largely diminished because of the delay
Workers want to know when they will get their payments
My question centres on the fuel allowance thresholds and the qualifying criteria
This will be a very important issue in the coming months
I want the Minister's opinion on the thresholds by which people will qualify
I thank the Minister of State
We can all agree that the fuel allowance at the moment is targeted in a certain way to a certain number of social welfare recipients
I believe this needs to broaden out to much more than the cohort of people who currently receive it
If a person is on illness benefit he or she does not get it
A person on disability benefit does not get the fuel allowance
There is a whole cohort of people who do not qualify
For example, a person may be on a small private pension along with a State pension
If this person is over the threshold by just €5 then he or she does not get the fuel allowance whatsoever
When one takes into account the spiralling cost of fuel the €33 fuel allowance is welcome but it must relate to the income a person has and the payment itself
A whole cohort who could benefit by a targeted measure are not benefitting
Perhaps the Minister of State will address this
I also wish to allude to another important point after the response
This winter we will see the apex of the cost-of-living crisis, particularly in energy prices
There have been 35 price hikes by energy companies in the past 12 months
The cumulative effect has been a 60% to 70% increase in electricity and gas prices
That is a fact
Another fact which the Minister will have to address is that since February this year, 20,000 people were refused fuel allowance
That is an enormous number
There is a lot of confusion in social welfare offices regarding those who are long-term unemployed for more than 12 months, for instance
They have changed the criteria, which is welcome, but there is a lot of confusion
That has to be addressed
It is only the tip of the iceberg
There are those who could benefit but who are not because of the confusion relating to the criteria
My question centres on the fuel allowance thresholds and the qualifying criteria
This will be a very important issue in the coming months
I want the Minister's opinion on the thresholds by which people will qualify
I thank the Minister of State
We can all agree that the fuel allowance at the moment is targeted in a certain way to a certain number of social welfare recipients
I believe this needs to broaden out to much more than the cohort of people who currently receive it
If a person is on illness benefit he or she does not get it
A person on disability benefit does not get the fuel allowance
There is a whole cohort of people who do not qualify
For example, a person may be on a small private pension along with a State pension
If this person is over the threshold by just €5 then he or she does not get the fuel allowance whatsoever
When one takes into account the spiralling cost of fuel the €33 fuel allowance is welcome but it must relate to the income a person has and the payment itself
A whole cohort who could benefit by a targeted measure are not benefitting
Perhaps the Minister of State will address this
I also wish to allude to another important point after the response
This winter we will see the apex of the cost-of-living crisis, particularly in energy prices
There have been 35 price hikes by energy companies in the past 12 months
The cumulative effect has been a 60% to 70% increase in electricity and gas prices
That is a fact
Another fact which the Minister will have to address is that since February this year, 20,000 people were refused fuel allowance
That is an enormous number
There is a lot of confusion in social welfare offices regarding those who are long-term unemployed for more than 12 months, for instance
They have changed the criteria, which is welcome, but there is a lot of confusion
That has to be addressed
It is only the tip of the iceberg
There are those who could benefit but who are not because of the confusion relating to the criteria
Landlords have never had it so good, to coin a phrase
Corporate landlords are having it really good
Corporate landlords were brought here after the crash by Fine Gael for one reason only, which was to make huge amounts of money
This is what they are doing
They own huge portfolios of apartments and houses throughout the State
In some cases they are getting paid by the State after getting a huge reduction in the cost of some of these houses
It is sickening to see it
There is a terrible legacy with regard to landlords in this country and there is the psyche of the Irish people
We fought against landlords when the Brits were here and we drove them out
That psyche and legacy are still here
A total of €1 billion per year is given to private landlords
This is indefensible
This money is going to private landlords
Half of it could build hundreds if not thousands of houses but we continue this policy
The Minister of State is a member of the Green Party
This policy is ideologically driven
We have a housing crisis and 11,000 people in emergency accommodation because of ideology
It is because of the decision to leave housing to the market and forget about the ideology of public housing
This is what it comes down to
This is the reason we have a housing crisis and all of the by-products and misery that come with it
I do not know whether the Minister of State can defend that
He is swimming with sharks in Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil
These people are maniacs who have no social conscience when it comes to people in situations such as this
In the South Dublin County Council area I am from, the average three-bedroom house costs €2,400 to rent
Who the hell can afford that? Average working people who can afford that will be pinned to their collar and will have very little money for anything else
What is wrong with rent control? It is a good idea that in a particular area if rents are very high, the State can say that rents must be a certain level
It is a good idea
Other countries have done it
Why can we not do it? Otherwise we will let the free market run wild
The invisible hand cannot be touched
I do not understand why this is being allowed to happen
Rent pressure zones were introduced five or six years ago
Even though rent pressure zones do not really work, they are an acceptance by the Government that we have to interfere somewhere on rent control
The rent pressure zones have failed
We need to go beyond rhetoric and have rent controls where people have a standard of living and not situations where people are homeless or cannot find a place
It is not acceptable
The Minister of State has to look at his position in government in defending these policies
This is what Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael have been all about
It is why we have a crisis
It is because of ideology
I do not know whether the Minister of State believes in that ideology
Was Michael Collins in Fine Gael?
I am sharing time with Deputy Boyd Barrett
I see the Minister is leaving the Chamber
I was about to let loose
I wonder whether the Minister has ever thought for one minute that the current housing policy and others that preceded it are and were wrong
I would like somebody on that side of the House to say, "You know what, I think we have got it wrong
" I am not getting that sense and I do not think it will ever happen
To deal with the housing crisis, we must look at what happened 20 years ago
There is a historical legacy of commodification and marketisation of homes
In fact, it is a basic need of human beings to have shelter
This discussion is like Groundhog Day because we are now in a situation where 10,000-plus people are in emergency accommodation
There is a crisis in regard to the provision of rental accommodation and affordable housing and those issues are only going to get worse
Several speakers alluded to the tsunami of notices to quit, with a huge number of people in line to be homeless come the autumn
Those figures are going to go north rather than south
This situation is completely untenable and unacceptable
One factor relates to the operation of the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme in the rental market
HAP rates are nowhere near market rental rates
Even in the case of the homeless HAP scheme, the amount of money that is being given to private landlords is obscene
In many cases, they are charging up to €2,400 per month for a home
These people should be wearing balaclavas because they are robbing the State
Some of the homes are not worth €2,400 by any means
This is both a historical legacy issue and a contemporary issue
It comes down to policy, choice and the decision to look at shelter as something that is all about the monetary value
This is not new
It has happened in Britain and elsewhere around the world, where speculators, or robbers, speculate on property
That is the situation in which many people find themselves
Homelessness and the housing crisis affect everybody at this stage
It is not the classical situation where it is just about the people who are homeless and living on the street
That is not the situation at the moment, if it ever was
The most recent general election probably was the most important election for a generation
It sent a message to Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, which have been ruling the country for the past 100 years, that people have had enough and are not going to take any more when it comes to public services, particularly housing, that are inadequate
It is the reason many people who voted for the Minister of State's party are now turning away from it
The housing crisis will be the key factor in the next general election, whenever it happens
If the Government does not address the issues we are talking about today, the parties in government will pay a heavy price
People do not forget the misery they have endured
Some have had to emigrate and others have had to go into emergency accommodation
It stays etched in people's minds that they have seen their children go into emergency accommodation
It is unacceptable that in such a wealthy country, more than 11,000 people have been allowed to end up homeless
My question relates to a report commissioned five years ago, namely, Cannabis for Medical Use - A Scientific Review, which was commissioned from the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA
One of the main recommendations was an access programme
That was five years ago
The programme has been extremely restrictive and has omitted many people who could benefit from medical cannabis
I want to get the Minister's views on the programme itself
I think the Minister will agree with me the policy of a ministerial licence was from the outset overly bureaucratic and very arduous for parents
Many parents had to fight tooth and nail to get access for their children
I have always found it strange that with the more than 40 people who have ministerial licence, there is no joined-up thinking
There is no research done or joined-up thinking
The access programme gives that kind of joined-up thinking
Twenty people is a very small number to be benefiting from medical cannabis
If we look at the Danish medical cannabis programme, which I will allude to in the next part, it has been broadened out with more conditions
The clinical review is very important
If the programme is not broadened in its conditions, I do not see it going anywhere for medical and commercial reasons
The Danish medical cannabis access programme has been open since 2018 and 2,500 patients have got medical cannabis products via prescription
Some of the conditions it is being prescribed for are not in the medical access programme here
One particular example of that is neuropathic pain
The evidence around the effect of cannabis on neuropathic pain is very good
Access programmes throughout the world allow cannabis for the treatment of chronic pain or neuropathic pain
Chronic pain is a very broad term
The omission of chronic pain in the initial report was very controversial
A whole host of people could benefit from medical cannabis, particularly for neuropathic pain

We saw during Covid-19, which is ongoing, the importance of laboratory scientists
A number of months ago those same laboratory scientists had to go on strike in relation to pay parity
What steps is the Minister taking to resolve this issue?
I welcome the fact a settlement may be possible in regard to the ongoing discussions
These laboratory scientists have waited for more than 20 years for pay parity
Some of their colleagues doing similar work have been paid about 8% more than them
They were very patient indeed
The strike was hugely popular, publicly
Obviously the laboratory scientists did not want to be on strike
They were compelled to go on strike because of that issue around equal pay for equal work
It is important that not only the pay issue is resolved but that so too are other issues to which I will allude in a supplementary question
Hopefully, this anomaly can be resolved
The workers have been waiting a considerable amount of time
Another issue the laboratory scientists have touched on relates to vacant posts in the profession
They said one in five posts are vacant
That is obviously worrying in the context of qualified staff such as those
Hopefully, those posts can be filled
The Minister cannot predict what could happen with regard to the WRC talks, but they sound positive
Hopefully, the matter will be resolved and some of these posts will be filled as soon as possible
As we saw during the pandemic, front-line staff such as laboratory scientists are crucial
In fact, the Minister will have seen that when they went on strike

Yesterday Professor Jack Lambert addressed the health committee in relation to the effects of long Covid-19
He is an infectious disease consultant at the Mater hospital and he painted a stark picture in regard to those suffering the symptoms of long Covid-19
He was quite critical of the present policy around treating those with long Covid-19
He cited an ambivalence in relation to his own medical profession towards those with long Covid-19
Long Covid-19 is interpreted as having more than three months of symptoms particularly around chronic fatigue
He was quite critical of the plan in relation to the State
Will the Minister address some of the issues raised by the professor around addressing some of the effects of long Covid-19?
I thank the Social Democrats for tabling this motion
It is very worthwhile to debate what is going on with disability services
As the Minister of State knows, people who have a disability are twice as likely to face discrimination than me and her
That is a fact
They will face discrimination in respect of consistent poverty, deprivation, isolation, employment, access to public services and housing
Those who have a disability who try to access housing is one of the key issues
There is a dearth of housing in South Dublin County Council for those who have a disability
I could tell many horror stories regarding those who have a disability who cannot get access to proper housing
The situation in South Dublin County Council is not an isolated one
I am sure it is the same throughout the State
On income and disability, the disability allowance is €208 per week
I always found it very weird that during the pandemic the vast majority of people got €350
That was the bar at which most people could live
The disability allowance should be far more than €208; it should be up to the level of €350
That should be looked at in the context of the budget
The cost-of-living crisis is having a major affect on those who are living with a disability
That has to be heeded
I will touch on the local authority housing adaptation grants
The income thresholds for those grants are far too low
The cost of adaptations goes far beyond the grant that is currently available
There is also a knock-on effect as regards the cost of living
I know families who just cannot afford the adaptation they need for their children or themselves
The thresholds for the grants, whether someone is in a public local authority house or owns his or her home, are far too small
They have to be looked at because families are going into debt
Families simply cannot afford the adaptation, or have to cut back on certain modifications, and sometimes it takes a long time to get these grants
I would like the Minister of State to look into that because it is very important for families, adults and so forth
There are many other matters I could mention
I do not understand why we have not ratified the protocol to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, CRPD
Only two other countries in the European Union have not ratified it
The action plan needs to be published without delay
That is very important
As I said, the income for those who are on disability or illness benefits has to be reviewed
That is probably out of the Minister of State's remit, but she will understand where I am coming from
For somebody who is on such payments for a considerable time, it is not a huge amount of money in the context of the cost of living in Ireland
It is actually very small
Some people want to contribute but sometimes, because of circumstances, they cannot, due to their disability
The disability allowance should be looked at
It should be much further north of €208 and closer to the level of payments made during the pandemic
People Before Profit welcomes this Bill
It is quite progressive, as is the contraception scheme
Outpatient charges are not conducive to Sláintecare whatsoever
I think the Minister would agree with that
Most people listening will be asking themselves why we pay inpatient charges in the first place
This is welcome but there is a long way still to go
Children who attend the emergency department will still be charged €100 for every visit if they do not have a medical card
That is not progressive
The charges will also still exist for inpatients
Those inpatient charges can be a financial burden on those who have to visit hospital on numerous occasions
That is not conducive to the Sláintecare policy
There is a juxtaposition between outpatient and inpatient charges and debt collection
In the past three years, the HSE paid €1
3 million to debt collectors
That is an incredible statistic
The HSE paid all that money over the past number of years to debt collectors to chase people up because they had not paid their charges
That is a complete waste of money
That money could easily have been spent on healthcare and on people presenting themselves in emergency departments
Sorry?
The €1
3 million was spent by the HSE on debt collectors
I am trying to get that information
It would be very interesting to see how much money they actually gathered
Charges should be abolished, full stop
The amount of bureaucracy that goes into this, between paying debt collectors and the administrative work involved in inpatient fees, is not efficient
This is in the context of the cost-of-living crisis many families are going through
This Bill is welcome so people will have to access healthcare and so forth
It is welcome that this is happening but there is a long way to go regarding stealth costs in our health system
The aim of Sláintecare is to have a universal healthcare system so that when people need access to healthcare, there is no financial penalty to pay
That is a good thing but there is still a long way to go to complete the policy of Sláintecare
Has the Minister had any engagement with his Polish counterpart or the European Union on the current banning of abortion in Poland? This is in the context of Ukrainian women coming into Poland and being refused abortions when they have been raped by Russian soldiers
The Polish people and Europe in general have shown amazing solidarity with Ukrainians who are fleeing their own country in the face of absolute barbarity by the Russian Federation
I am aware that there is an ongoing debate in Poland, which will be debated in the Polish Parliament as of today, in respect of the lifting of the ban on abortions, not only for Polish women but for anybody fleeing the situation in Ukraine
The rape of women as a weapon of war is the most heinous of crimes and I highlight the situation where women present themselves in Poland but cannot gain access to having an abortion, having been raped in that situation
I urge the Minister to highlight this terrible situation in Poland at European level and with his counterpart in Poland

In 2019, medical cannabis was recognised as a medical intervention
That was underpinned by legislation by the then Minister for Health, Deputy Harris
Nine months ago the medical cannabis access programme commenced
Many of us who campaigned for that programme were joyous
Since then only 12 patients have been prescribed medical cannabis under prescription for the first time under the health service
This is far too restrictive
People who need access have to go to the black market, some go abroad or worse still, as I am told in the many weekly calls I receive, have to go without
Many of us welcomed this programme but it is far too restrictive
Looking at the same model in Denmark, thousands of people have access to the medical cannabis access programme there
The review is due this year and I do not think the current programme criteria are fit for purpose
I am sharing time with Deputy Paul Murphy
I welcome this important motion on respite care services
It is good we are talking about the issue but we have to view it in both a post-pandemic and a pre-pandemic light
Respite care services are a vital cog in the system of care
In a previous life, before being elected to the House, I worked in respite services so I understand their importance for family members and service users
For the people who work in respite and other care services, it has, to say the least, been very difficult over the past two years to deal with the ongoing public health emergency
The provision of respite care has been arbitrary for the families trying to get access, and it has been very difficult for some families who just cannot get the hours
Earlier during the pandemic, the withdrawal of day and respite services had a profound effect
It is almost incalculable what it did to service users, children, family members and staff
The services were gone completely
If a person does not have a routine, a relationship with his or her peer group, an educational space or other supports, it can have a terrible effect on family members and others
The State is still recovering in that regard, as are the services
Will the Minister of State outline what the State has done to fill that enormous void that opened over the past two years? I will always be haunted by some of the news reports about families for whom that service was simply gone
It was so distressing to hear family members say they had nothing and describe how they could now see their child regressing, Many carers provide a vital service, not only for their children, loved ones and so forth, and that can go unnoticed at times
There should be a statutory entitlement for carers to 20 days' annual leave for the work they do
That should be put into legislation in order that carers will be given time off
That would make sense and most people would agree to it, given there would be a significant benefit-in-kind to the State whereby carers would save it vast sums by avoiding the need to have their loved one enter a hospital environment
Will the Minister of State outline his opinion on the effects of the pandemic on day services and respite services? Where have interventions been made to fill the void that has appeared? We need more resources, not least where that void has opened over the past two and a half years
Last week the Health Research Board, HRB, issued a report on drug treatment from 2015 to 2021
To say it made for sombre reading is an understatement
One of the main findings of the report relates to cocaine use in Ireland
Treatment for cocaine use soared by 171% over an eight-year period and cocaine has now overtaken heroin as the main problem drug in Ireland
While I, along with my party colleagues and many other Deputies in this House, welcome the harm reduction policy of the HSE and the Department of Health, we need to go beyond that because it is largely lip service
We need to talk about drug addiction in a very frank way, particularly in the context of the Citizen's Assembly
Having read the HRB's report, it is clear that we are losing the war against drugs, whether we like it or not
It is a losing battle and we need to change direction
Thirty-five children with cystic fibrosis have been excluded from accessing the drug Kaftrio
The reasons for their exclusion are primarily price and age
This is an ongoing dispute with the HSE and the manufacturer of the drug, Vertex
The families of those 35 children have been requesting a meeting with the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, as soon as possible to clarify the situation
As the Minister will understand, the families do not want a protracted series of events going on for years, as has happened with other drugs in the past
A number of families have contacted me and other Deputies here to say they want this drug to be available for the 35 children
They are being excluded generally because of price and age but they want to get this drug as soon as possible
This is not a new drug
It is a drug that has been-----
In the past number of days, two health unions - the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, and the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO - have made a significant statement on the state of the health service and the conditions of their members
Junior doctors have voted overwhelmingly to take strike action in response to long hours, deteriorating work conditions and, most worryingly, constant breaches of the European working time directive
Alarm bells are ringing for everybody in respect of our health service
If we cannot keep doctors and nurses safe in their workplace, they will not remain in the health service and will go somewhere else
How is the Taoiseach trying to address this and stop nurses and doctors leaving the country?

I commend Sinn Féin on its motion
It is very good
We are probably debating something we should not be debating because there should not be a need for a debate on special education for children, yet we continue to debate it not only in this Chamber but also outside it
The issue may seem abstract when debating it but it is not so abstract when it comes to parents and their children not being provided for in September
It is completely unacceptable that this continues in 2022
History will judge successive Governments to have let down children by not providing the basic right to an education
Two hundred and forty-one children will not have an appropriate place come September
At least 112 children between the ages of one and six are waiting for an appropriate school place
The stress this brings on is incalculable
That the children will not have a place is unacceptable
As other Deputies have said, many parents come to our constituency offices and tell us their children will have no school places in September
My head drops when that happens
As I have said before, Deputies are the last people to whom parents seeking special educational provision speak
That means the system has failed, and that is just not good enough in 2022
I have raised with the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, the matter of autism spectrum disorder, ASD, places, particularly at secondary school
At present, the ratio between places at primary and secondary levels is 3:1
Therefore, there is a serious shortage of ASD places in secondary schools
In the Leinster area, including Dublin, the ratio is 3:1
Therefore, for every three places at primary level, there is one at second level
This will lead to a major shortage of appropriate places in secondary schools
This is already happening
Some secondary schools are stepping up to the plate and some have reservations about resources, places and so forth
It is important the resources be put in place
I can speak only for the area I represent
I realise there is a major shortage in secondary schools every September
That has to be addressed
The special education centres are a complete non-runner
The Minister should state they will be completely ruled out
Parents I have been speaking to, although not all, have said they are not a good idea as they almost institutionalise the special education of their children
The section 37A legal process compels schools to make provision for special education
Again, it entails a very arduous, bureaucratic system
Ultimately, schools probably will not be compelled to provide special educational places
We should not have circumstances in which schools must be compelled
If schools were given the resources and adequate provision were made, every one of them would provide special education in the classroom
There is no doubt about that, but there is a barrier between the resources schools want and what the Department of Education can provide
I do not want to be overly political about this
Sometimes you have to leave your politics behind but this needs to be sorted out
It should have been sorted out yesterday
I know that, on a personal basis, the Minister of State is embarrassed by this
It is embarrassing that hundreds of children do not have an appropriate place for September, which is not acceptable
Let us leave all the politics behind and we will support the Minister of State, as Opposition Deputies, to finally resolve this issue
This has been decades in the making and successive Governments simply have not worked it out
This is a very wealthy country and there are a lot of resources
For children to be denied an education when they are between five and eight years old is unacceptable
I hope that in the two and a half years left of this Government, if it lasts that long, it can at least address some of the issues that are letting down children
My questions in on the pandemic recognition payment
That payment, which everybody welcomed, was to recognise the sacrifice that healthcare workers made during the pandemic
Thus far only two hospitals have paid the bonus to healthcare workers
It is incredible that this situation is continuing
Who is getting the payment is quite arbitrary and there is much frustration in regard to front-line workers
Will the Minister address the issue as to when workers will get this payment, hopefully within the next couple of weeks?
People Before Profit largely welcome this legislation
There will be amendments and changes made on Committee Stage and, hopefully, at the end of that process, the legislation will be fit for purpose
This has been seven years or more in the making
Some references, for example, those relating to the lunacy laws, date back 140 years, which shows how antiquated this legislation is
The more I read the Bill, the more I realise how complicated it is
Legal, moral and ethical questions arise and must be answered
At the heart of the debate is the fact that we need to get away from a paternal approach to healthcare, particularly the aspect of it relating to mental health, and to instead have a person-centred health system where the person is at the centre of decisions that are made
I welcome the decision around wards of court
Those are complicated situations but taking that decision away from the criminal justice system and moving to a support service is welcome
It will oversee the implementation of this legislation
I listened intently to the concerns outlined by Deputy Cairns
Those concerns should be taken into account
Some campaigners have said there are serious concerns around persons who are involuntarily detained under the Mental Health Act
Those situations must be taken into account when this legislation is finalised
There is still a long way to go when we consider where this Bill will end up
My understanding is that the deliberations on it must be finished in the next four weeks
On Committee Stage, there will be many amendments to address some of the issues that have been raised
I hope that future legislation deals with the issue of voluntary assisted dying
If implemented, it would have consequences with regard to advance health decisions and would allow control and choice to those in that situation
I hope that legislation will be introduced and implemented in this country in the near future
This is a complicated area of law
I am the first person to say that some of the stuff involved is probably beyond my remit
I am probably not qualified to address some of the issues, but I am a legislator, after all, and have been elected by the people of Dublin Mid-West to have an input and a say
I am a voice for campaigners on this issue
We are a conduit for those people to say there are certain matters about which we have concerns but we hope those concerns can be addressed on Committee Stage
We hope that at the end of that process, the legislation will be fit for purpose
Earlier, the National Traveller Mental Health Network held a protest outside the Dáil in respect of Traveller mental health
It held a similar protest five months ago
One of its main calls at the time was for a meeting with the Taoiseach
At today's protest, there was a sense of music and a sense of poetry but there was also a deep sense of hopelessness and despair within the Traveller community regarding Traveller mental health
It is an atrocious situation
On "Morning Ireland" earlier, a member of the Traveller community spoke about the 29 members of her extended family who have died by suicide
That is an absolutely atrocious situation
I have two questions
Will the Taoiseach meet with representatives from the network immediately? Will the action plan for Traveller mental health be implemented as soon as possible?
I move:That Dáil Éireann:notes that:— medical scientists carry out the same work as other scientist colleagues in hospital laboratories, but are paid on average eight per cent less, with fewer promotional opportunities and less support for training and education;— pay parity with clinical biochemists was awarded in 2001 following the Report of the Expert Group on Medical Laboratory Technician/Technologist Grades and was agreed by the Health Service Executive (HSE) and the Department of Health, however, this was lost due to an unintentional procedural effect of the 2002 benchmarking process;— there is an ongoing and large national shortage of medical scientists across the public health service due to lesser pay and conditions, insufficient third-level places, poor career structure and limited promotional opportunities, and up to 20 per cent of medical scientist posts in hospitals are vacant;— the Medical Laboratory Scientists Association (MLSA) warned against the Government's decision in 2006 to outsource testing to the United States, due to the different testing and screening protocols in place and the disconnect between the outsourced screening programme and the clinical services in Ireland for women subsequently diagnosed with cervical cancer, and concern was also expressed about the loss to the State of the skills to provide the service;— medical scientists are the hidden heroes of the health service, as they are the people who process test samples for Covid-19, who do blood tests, who test urine and stool samples, and they have been under intense pressure during the Covid-19 pandemic;— there is huge frustration and burn-out of medical scientists because of a severe recruitment and retention problem which has been ignored by the HSE and Department of Health for many years;— last November, MLSA members voted 98 per cent in favour of taking industrial action in pursuit of their pay parity claim and recruitment for vacant posts; and— the MLSA planned for strike action in late March/early April 2022, but deferred this action to accept an invitation to meet the Public Sector Agreement Group (PSAG), however, satisfactory progress was not achieved, and industrial action began last week and continues this week;further notes that:— inflation has reached seven per cent and pay increases, at least equal to the rate of inflation, are necessary to protect all workers' real incomes;— the MLSA action follows many rounds of unsuccessful talks with the HSE, Department of Health, Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER) and the PSAG;— the HSE has told the MLSA that funding for pay parity is a decision for DPER, but DPER has not engaged meaningfully with the MLSA over its pay claim;— the MLSA has made every effort to avoid the disruption to patients and fellow healthcare workers, but has been left with no alternative but to take this action;— up to 14,000 outpatient appointments were cancelled on the first day of strike action, with significant impacts on Emergency Departments, the number of patients on trolleys and on general practitioner services;— the vast majority of MLSA members have been on picket lines at all public voluntary and HSE hospitals during the last week and have received enormous public support for their action; and— further days of strike action are planned next week on 31st May and 1st-2nd June; andcalls on the Government to:— ensure that DPER and the HSE agree to the long-standing pay parity award recommended over two decades ago, and immediately implement the average eight per cent pay increase sought by MLSA members; — begin a recruitment campaign to fill the estimated 20 per cent of medical scientist posts that are currently vacant; and— publish a plan for the rapid rebuilding of testing capabilities and capacity in the public health service, and to end the outsourcing of testing to the private sector
I welcome to the Public Gallery some members of the Medical Laboratory Scientists Association members
They are very welcome
It was not too long ago that we were all clapping for them, but the Government has forgotten to clap for them in relation to pay and retention of staff
It is 21 years since a report of the expert group on medical laboratory technician grades recommended pay parity between medical scientists and clinical biochemists
The HSE and the Department of Health accepted that recommendation 21 years ago
It is an established fact that MLSA members are paid on average 8% less than their colleagues doing the same work
This is only the second time the association has taken industrial action in the 60 years of its existence
Medical scientists are sometimes the workers we do not see but they play a vital part in our health service
Never was this more evident than during the continued fight against Covid-19
The Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, will share my view in that regard
They are the hidden heroes among front-line staff
They process test samples to make sure medical procedures go ahead
Despite this, one in five medical scientist positions remains vacant
In November last year, 98% of MLSA members voted in favour of industrial action
For medical scientists it feels as though the Government, the HSE, the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform have all absolved themselves from responsibility on this issue
In addition, our motion calls on the Government to rebuild the testing capacity in the public health service system and end the outsourcing of testing to the private sector
I put it to the Minister that no set of workers should be in this position of pay discrimination
Yesterday, when most of us were on the picket line, there was a huge outpouring of public support for the workers
The workers did not want to be there
They wanted to be in their workplaces
They were forced, however, by this historical legacy of pay parity injustice
I am aware that the dispute has gone to the Labour Court but the issue must be resolved, not only for the workers themselves, but also for staff retention in the general public health system
We must keep professional staff in the health system
If we do not, we will keep haemorrhaging staff and returning to this issue year after year
That the situation has been allowed to get this far is pretty shambolic
As I said, a number of months ago we were all clapping for front-line staff in the pandemic
That reflected a genuine feeling for these workers who were going into their workplace each day, sometimes in fear that they might catch the virus or bring it back to their families
These workers were at the front line of Covid-19 as regards testing and capacity
It is shambolic that this was allowed to happen and workers are on strike
I hope the dispute will be resolved very soon
The workers do not want to go back out on strike
They want to be in their workplace
We have gone beyond platitudes
This strike and dispute need to be resolved immediately so the workers can go back to the job and continue to play their vital role in the health service
I thank all Members for their positive commentary on this important issue in the past two hours
I also thank the MLSA members in the Gallery for attending to hear what Teachtaí Dála from the Opposition and the Government are saying about their workplace
We again thank them for their continued work in their jobs
I will cut to the chase
If there was an anomaly in Deputies' pay it would not have taken 20 years to fix
It would have taken 20 minutes
Let us be honest that Deputies are overpaid and if this situation had involved them it would have been fixed
There are pay anomalies across the board in the public sector involving teachers, FEMPI cuts, workers in section 56 and 59 organisations and school secretaries
There are different sets of rules
I want to go back to the historical context for this issue
It is 21 years since the recommendation was made
Since then there have been five general elections, numerous health Ministers, a financial crisis and a pandemic
The pandemic changed everything about public health
Medical scientists were and continue to be at the forefront of public health
They have been waiting in the wings for this issue of pay parity to be fixed
It is ludicrous
It is absolutely shambolic that medical laboratory scientists have been on the picket line in the past two weeks
It is ludicrous
Think about it
They are the very people who have been trying to save people
They are looking for a very small pay increase
The health budget is approximately €22 billion
I am guessing that if tomorrow they were given the 8% they seek it would be an absolute fraction of this
I guess it would cost less than €7 million or €8 million per year
It does not make sense
With regard to the retention and recruitment of staff there is an existential crisis in the health service
As politicians we see it on a daily basis
Health staff are burned out
They love their jobs and they are absolutely passionate about their work but they tell us and their colleagues that at present the circumstances they are in are extremely difficult
Some are leaving the country because they are burned out
This is not sustainable
It will have an effect not only on the health service but on the workers who keep it going
I appeal to the Minister and other Ministers present to resolve this issue and give these workers the 8% increase they deserve
Today, the HSE announced a good initiative for the reduction of harmful drug use at festivals
It is a good, progressive step
There is a major anomaly in what the Government has done previously compared with now
I do not think it has the stomach to tackle drug use in Ireland
The citizens' assembly on drug use has been delayed, nearly two years into the term of this Government, which is incredible
I do not get a sense of urgency or that this is an important issue
At the same time, people are dying because of the failed policy relating to drug use in Ireland
Somebody should say that it has failed
Over the weekend, the Psychiatric Nurses Association confirmed that 11 out of 23 beds would close until September at the Linn Dara site in Cherry Orchard
We were here five years ago
Alarm bells ring when a state-of-the-art facility such as Linn Dara, which provides an absolutely vital service for young people, cannot provide staff
If this happened five years ago, why did the HSE and the Department of Health not foresee this? It is just not acceptable, in 2022, that a facility such as Linn Dara should have to close beds
Nobody accepts that, but it has happened
Will somebody answer these questions, not just for me, but most importantly for the parents and the people who will use this facility?
Journalism is an art form
Many of us admire the great journalists who have exposed the brutality of some terrible regimes
It is a skill in itself
It is a skill of telling the truth to us all
Those words could summarise Shireen Abu Akleh
She was a journalist who enjoyed great trustworthiness and respect across not only the Middle East but the whole world
Two weeks ago, Israel murdered her in cold blood
She was just one of many journalists targeted by the Israel Defense Forces over the past 20 years
Believe it or not, the Israel Defense Forces have a systematic policy of targeting Palestinian journalists because journalists expose the brutality of the Israeli system
To make matters worse, the Israel Defense Forces stated over the weekend that they will not investigate Shireen's murder
Criminals such as the State of Israel do not have a great track record of investigating themselves
That says everything about Israel
What is happening is incredible not only with regard to journalists but also the citizens of Palestine
Israel does not even recognise the International Criminal Court in respect of extrajudicial murders which Israel carries out
My question to the Minister is very simple
We have said this many times in the Chamber
Why is there no sanction against Israel? Why are there no consequences for Israel's actions? The Government pays lip service to action in response to what Israel does but there are no consequences
There could be simple things done
One is expelling the Israeli ambassador
There are a number of other things, particularly economic sanctions
There seems to be a lack of guile in how we treat Israel
We must recognise what it is
Israel is an apartheid state
If the Government does not recognise that, there is an issue
It is not just us saying it
Many NGOs such as Amnesty International, B'Tselem and others are exposing Israel for what it is
It is an apartheid, racist state
Why will the Minister not recognise that it is an apartheid state? Most importantly, why are there no sanctions against Israel not only from Ireland but from the European Union?
This centres around the community safety innovation fund the Department announced on 11 April
I want to find out about the longevity of the fund
Will it be directed towards communities affected by crime?
I welcome this funding from the proceeds of crime and the Criminal Assets Bureau
I can think of many initiatives and projects that could benefit from this funding, particularly in the area I represent, which has been greatly affected by organised crime
The profits largely go unseen by CAB but the community will benefit from an element of them through this fund
From my understanding, there is no correlation between the funding and areas affected by crime
The initiative is welcome
Its precursor was the Dormant Accounts Fund, from which many projects benefited
We agree that the best way to tackle the causes of crime is to invest in communities
I would argue that social deprivation and marginalisation draw people into criminality
It can be very complex
Criminality involving drugs is extremely profitable
With the trappings comes a huge amount of money
There is an echelon who do extremely well out of that and who generally do not live in the communities affected
Communities then feel the effects of that criminality
I do not have time to tease out the reasons
We must adopt a different approach to how we treat people who are drawn into crime
They are not bad people
They are just drawn in by the alternative economy
That economy can be a massive draw, especially in working-class areas
It draws in so many people who should not be there
In an ideal world, the funding of communities should not come from CAB sources
In a better world, where people are not drawn into crime, Government and State agencies would fund projects on their own initiative

On my way to Leinster House today, I visited Cherry Orchard Hospital, where medical scientists are on strike in relation to pay and retention, among many other matters
On the way here, many of us would have seen a lot of flags around the place indicating support for front-line workers
There are two such flags in Kilmainham, which I go by everyday
I always think of that time when front-line workers protected all of us in the context of Covid-19
It is absolutely shambolic that 2,000 medical scientists are on strike for better pay and conditions when they were at the front line in the fight against Covid-19
Those workers have a justified pay claim
That pay claim needs to be dealt with
I welcome this important debate
Just transition is not just a national policy but an international policy
Environmentalists use the great phase that we must act locally and think globally
Everything we do locally is everything we do globally
For a just transition, we need to think of the environmental space as the place and country in which we live and the world we all share
That policy is important, as the Minister of State knows, because to tackle the environmental damage that has been done, and continues to be done, we need to be radical in what we do, individually, collectively and politically
I wish to speak about one aspect of the just transition, namely, the retrofit programme
I will speak from personal experience
The estate in which I live in Clondalkin, which is made up of 40 houses, applied for the community energy grant scheme
Deep retrofit of a house is revolutionary
It has transformed energy bills
In an ideal world, it would be fantastic if everyone could do likewise but that is not possible because it takes time to retrofit housing
I will share with the House some statistics that show the challenge around the retrofit of, in particular, local authority houses
South Dublin County Council has just under 10,000 and less than 1% were retrofitted last year
If one does the maths, it will take decades to complete
The scheme has ramped up this year with the retrofit of 250 houses but at that rate, it will take a considerable amount of time to complete
I have heard some reports, though not relating to the estate I am from, that some of the works have been haphazard and that there may be a problem in terms of the standard of the retrofit
It could be problematic not only in the present but also in the future
The retrofit programme needs to be extended to everybody
It is important to do that regardless of people's means
We are asking people to spend €50,000 upfront and that is an enormous amount of money
Many people cannot afford that and it can be a barrier to retrofitting
In Italy, the vast majority of people will get a retrofit of their homes completely free of charge
The Italian Government has brought forward that policy for retrofitting
It is good that there are no financial impediments to retrofitting
Retrofitting is one of the cornerstones of a just transition
Everyone who has a house, whether provided by a local authority or a private house, in this country is lucky
Our energy bills and carbon footprints need to be smaller and that can be addressed and achieved through the retrofit programme
We need to be more ambitious and ensure the programme is State-led rather than looking for the invisible hand of the private sector to address those issues
That can be problematic because of the limits on the number of houses, particularly local authority houses, that can be retrofitted
The figures at the moment suggest it will take decades before the last people on the list have their houses retrofitted
Retrofitting can make an enormous difference to people's homes, particularly in wintertime when their energy bills are high
A person who is facing fuel poverty spends a considerable proportion of his or her cash on energy bills
If such people had their houses retrofitted, it is a no-brainer that their bills would go down and they would be spending less
The environmental damage would also be reduced
That should give us pause for thought
Like me and most Members of the House, the Taoiseach will have been horrified by the cold-blooded murder of Palestinian journalist, Shireen Abu Akleh
To compound that misery, the Israel Defense Forces attacked sympathisers just for waving the Palestinian flag
Some 50 Palestinian journalists have been systematically murdered by the Israel Defense Forces over the past 20 years
Many people in this country will say that we have to go beyond condemnation and sanction the Israeli state on the basis of systematic murder, occupation and brutality
While the world looks on, lip service is paid in that regard
What is the Government going to do? We did it in the 1980s in respect of apartheid South Africa
Why can we not do it to apartheid Israel?
To say the past two weeks have been a sorry saga is an underestimation
In the past nine years, successive Governments have had a chance to get this right but have got it very wrong
We all agree that maternity services in the places where women have children are antiquated
We all agree with that
Those services need to be modernised
The heart of the debate, and not only in the past nine years, has related to religious interference in healthcare
Such interference has a sorry past
We must look at the past, the present and the future
The past, as I said, has included religious interference in women's healthcare
It has been a sorry past
In the present, we have a two-tier system, private and public, which causes fault lines across society
People who live in certain parts of Ireland still cannot get access to abortion services
That is a fact
We do not know the future and that is why there is some ambiguity regarding the 300-year lease
What we do know is that this generation has thrown the yoke of Christian doctrine away, as well as all of the inequality that existed previously
It has the shape of marriage equality and Repeal, and this generation will accept nothing less than the separation of church and State
Time will tell whether the Government has made an enormous mistake
People may look back in ten or 15 years and ask why the Government handed that land over to a private entity
I raise an issue that is very different from those we have just discussed
In two months' time, the Clondalkin Equine Club, which promotes urban horse ownership and equine education, will close
This is incredible because thus far the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has spent €800,000 building and funding the project
I cannot fault the Department whatsoever; it has done a brilliant job
We are in a situation where 20 young people will have nowhere to stable their horses come July
This is a travesty when we consider the amount of money - up to €70 billion - that has been paid to the horse industry
The club is looking for a fraction of that
We speak about young people's health and well-being
In July, this club will have to close for the sake of a small amount of money
I appeal to the Government to come together and develop an interdepartmental response to fund this project
The council said it will not do that
I welcome this Bill, which is very topical in the context of workers trying to weather the current storm of inflation
It is up to the Government to determine whether it will legislate for a living wage, but the trade union movement also has a huge part to play in representing the one in five workers who find themselves in low-paid employment
Most of that employment is in hospitality, retail and food production
Some companies in those sectors are extremely profitable while paying their workers what can only be described as an unliveable wage
An important issue in the debate about pay is the phenomenon, which is not new, of the working poor
People, mainly women, are working in full-time jobs but are struggling
Indeed, they are struggling so much that they find it hard to exist
It is quite incredible that people who are going out to work for 39 hours per week are finding the basics unaffordable
The cost-of-living crisis is having an enormous impact on workers' standard of living
Their spending power now is nothing like it was even two or three years ago
The price rise spiral is pushing people into poverty who were never in poverty before, and that will have a negative social impact
I urge the Minister of State to think of the benefits of a living wage
The first and most obvious benefit is that workers on a living wage would have at least €100 more than they would have if they were on the minimum wage
Obviously, that means they have more money in their pocket, which they will spend in the economy
People on a living wage, who are earning more than they would earn on a minimum wage, will be more productive and happier, and that will trickle down into their family and social life
All of the evidence across the industrialised world shows that clearly
We cannot talk about low pay in isolation or without referring to the wealthy in this country who are doing incredibly well
Ireland ranks as the 14th richest in the world in terms of its GDP
The wealthy, the elite and the super-rich are doing extremely well while workers are struggling, but there is only so much inequality any society can take
There are pressure points and fault lines and it is imperative this Government introduces a living wage as soon as possible
I raise the shortage of hormone replacement therapy, HRT, products in the State
Several factors are at work here, including demand, supply and price
Some women are finding it difficult to source some HRT products in the State
The British Government has prioritised this issue in respect of the demand, supply and price
What is the State doing about the situation many women here find themselves in?
One in 12 children is now on some form of hospital waiting list
More than 100,000 children are on some form of National Treatment Purchase Fund list
One in three children has been waiting longer than a year for treatment or assessment by a hospital consultant
Over the Easter period, the Irish Hospital Consultants Association issued a press release on these figures
It states children will suffer from health and developmental issues that could have been reversed or mitigated if only they had been seen in time
What does this say about the State and the public health service?
I have been a board member of Clondalkin Equine Club for the past five years
I was one of the co-founders of the club ten years ago
The concept was somewhat unique in a context where there was an enormous number of problems relating to equine welfare in the Clondalkin area
Horse owners got together more than ten years ago to appeal to the council and the authorities to prevent a type of revolving door system whereby horses were impounded and destroyed, which resulted in animosity
The club has brought all the educational and safety guidelines to bear on the project
The money we are talking about is a pittance relative to what the State gives to Horse Racing Ireland, which amounts to approximately €70 million a year
Clondalkin Equine Club is asking for a very small amount
Urban horse ownership is a great tradition in working-class areas in Limerick, Cork and Dublin
It stems from the movement of people from inner cities to suburbs and the tradition of horses being used both for work and as a hobby
There are 20 horses stabled at the club and it facilitates 20 children as well as their parents
Speaking as a board member and a representative of the area, the idea that it will close in July is an absolute travesty
For the amount that is needed, it would be an absolute sin to see the closure of a club that gives joy to so many young people
I hope we can find a solution over the next couple of months
I speak as a board member of the club
The board and the club have exhausted every single known funding avenue to the point where we are at this juncture
If we do not get this small amount of funding, the club will have no alternative, unfortunately, but to close its doors in July
As I said, that would be an absolute travesty in respect of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine
I commend the Department
It has been really good in promoting urban horse ownership
Previously, people who owned horses in working-class areas were marginalised and stigmatised and looked upon as scumbags, but that is not the case
The majority of people who keep horses in working-class areas manage and keep their horses very well
A minority could not look after a goldfish, never mind a horse
It is so important this club is kept open

I raise an issue today with the Tánaiste and perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, who is present, may be in a better position to answer this question
It relates to the progressing disability services for children and young people
A number of families in my constituency and outside it have raised the lack of services with me
These families have children with Down’s syndrome
They have painted a very stark picture in respect of the interventions they were meant to receive
The Minister of State will be aware that these children have not got those interventions for the past couple of years
These are the basic services required for any child’s development
I refer to speech and language therapy, physiotherapy and occupational therapy
If we cannot provide for the most vulnerable children, then there is something very wrong not only with the Government but also with the whole system
My question relates to the future of the proposed national maternity hospital on the grounds of St
Vincent's University Hospital
Its construction has been something of a saga
People want clarity on its proposed ethos and ownership
Is the Minister confident that will happen because this has been an ongoing saga for the past ten years? For the casual observer, it is extremely confusing in relation to the ownership of the land and the ethos of the building itself
I understand the building will be owned by the State but the board will still be run by a private holding, that is, the Religious Sisters of Charity
If that is the case, that may not be conducive to a Catholic ethos - I understand the Minister is probably on the same page as we are - but there is something gone awry in relation to ethos in one guise and the ownership and public money
All that does not add to where we all want to go
There is confusion
I will take the Minister's word on that
What the women of Ireland will want to know is when will construction begin
We have seen projects in the State previously that are completely dragged out and, eventually, they may never be built
A modern hospital for the 21st century has to have a modern ethos to fit the 21st century
We live in a different era from when it was established on Holles Street
It was a completely different age in Ireland
I will take the Minister at his word
What I want to get from the last segment of my contribution is the details on when this will be signed off and the work will begin on the St
Vincent's campus

Vincent's campus
I welcome this document, which is subtitled "Listen
Invest
Deliver
" For many years, however, none of that was done
In fact, many women were never listened to and there was disinvestment in women's health and society as a whole
As a consequence of that, women's health was subordinate in society and in healthcare
One of the greatest advocates for women's healthcare in recent times has been Vicky Phelan
Her testimony and life experience have been instrumental in how we deal with women's healthcare
Vicky advocated for something very unique in Irish society, that being, a change in perception and encouraging women to challenge the paternalistic culture that exists in healthcare
It is a top-down culture that looks down on women from the very top
Vicky's input so far has been fantastic
I wish to speak about this document
It is important that perinatal mental health services have been advocated for
I welcome that there will be more specialists, not only in Dublin but also in Cork
From my understanding of endometriosis, on which I do not have much information, a large number of women are not being diagnosed and have had to go elsewhere to get treatment
My final point is on one of the most important issues and relates to progressing the early detection of breast cancer
There is a very strong argument to be made for lowering the age for breast screening from 50 to 40
There are undoubtedly pros and cons, but a very good argument for lowering the age not only has to do with early detection, but, most importantly, saving women's lives
I urge the Minister, who has just left the Chamber, to consider early detection and to lower the breast screening age to 40
The concept of neutrality in this country is under threat like never before
Commentary in this House and other forums is now advocating for a different approach and policy
Ireland has a proud history of neutrality, going back centuries
That concept is never, ever to aid and abet militarism and war
Neutrality is never to be complicit in other states' wars of domination and conquest
It is against militarism and joining any military pact by stealth, since those promote conflict, regardless of where they are
Ireland's reputation across the world is second to none with regard to social justice, peacekeeping and standing up for the oppressed across the world
We should know, because Ireland has a proud history of standing up to oppression, imperialism and the terrible effects of war
That is an ongoing factor in what we feel ourselves
There is a bloody blot on neutrality in Ireland
That is the use of Shannon Airport in the last three decades
Does the Minister of State know how many people have been killed in the two Iraqi wars in the last three decades? Half a million people have been killed, an incredible number
The vast majority were civilians
Ireland has facilitated American personnel coming through Shannon Airport on the way to Iraq
People in this country are brutalised by the idea that ordinary people in Iraq were subjected to the worst violence by the most powerful country in the world, which Ireland was complicit in
That is why we stand with the oppressed
We should have no truck whatsoever with militarism, whatever its form
That is a fact and a bloody blot on Ireland's neutrality
Ireland was complicit with the American army and in the ongoing conflict in the Middle East
The vast majority of people in this country support neutrality
They understand the concept and want to keep it that way
That is why we have tabled this legislation
It forms a debate and copper-fastens neutrality in this country
I wish to share time with Deputy Paul Murphy
I commend Sinn Féin on this very important motion
We have debated for a considerable amount of time over the period I have been in this House the issue of disability services for children
From my point of view and that of my colleagues, we have always tried to be constructive rather than destructive and tried not to make politics of it
It is sometimes difficult not to make politics of issues but, on this issue, we try to be as constructive as possible
This issue goes back a considerable amount of time
As with many other issues, there are legacy issues in regard to how we treat children and how we treat public health in this country
What we are talking about is children being denied very basic services and very basic civil rights, in my opinion and, I believe, in everybody else's opinion
Once those services are denied, a child's development can be greatly affected in regard to life expectancy and so forth
What we had in the past 17 years was a quite incredible situation where the Government was breaching its own laws around the Disability Act
It got more absurd when families trying to access these services had to go to the High Court
Two hundred families went through that process to access basic services
That situation got even more absurd when a High Court judge a couple of weeks ago said the standard operating procedure was not compatible with the Disability Act and the Government is basically breaking its own law
Families have to go before the judge in the High Court to say they are not getting the services they need
It is a ludicrous situation
Will the Minister review the Disability Act 2005? It was passed 17 years ago and was, in its essence, a good Act
It gave a timeframe of six months within which families could get an assessment of needs
We would all say that if people could get those services, we would be doing well
The reality is so different
As I have said many times, when somebody comes into my office and the first thing they say is about assessment of needs, my head drops to the ground because I know how useless I am in that situation
That family is going through this mechanism and has to wait years
If families are coming to Deputies, then the system is completely flawed
They should never be coming near Deputies
They should be coming through the HSE early intervention team and using the procedures in place to get those services
Families and children are denied and left to their own devices
They sometimes have to go private, which is expensive
Even if they go private now, there are huge waiting lists
The situation is as grave as it can get, and is coupled with the situation in relation to the Disability Act
In real life, families have to wait up to three and a half or four years for basic services, such as speech and language therapy or occupational therapy
You would want to have a heart of stone when somebody says their child who is four will be seven and a half before they get the services
This is a wealthy country
It is not poor by any means and should have the provision to treat children in a civil way
Will the Minister review the Disability Act? By my reckoning, it is not fit for purpose
Given the extraordinary number of Covid cases in the past week and the statement by the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation calling for the reintroduction of mask-wearing in crowded settings to ease the pressure on our public health service, will the Government review the decision it made earlier this month on ending the mandate of mask-wearing in public settings, namely, in retail outlets and on public transport?
The decision by the Government to delay a citizens' assembly on drug use is an affront to the debate
How any Government can prioritise a directly elected mayor over the urgent debate on drug use is beyond comprehension
Let us provide the context
This issue has been delayed for decades while thousands of people die and rot
The assembly that should be in the dock is not the citizens' assembly, but rather this assembly
This assembly has for decades let communities rot
Thousands of people would be alive today if it was not for the antiquated laws around drug use
Most of those people do not have a voice, but we are giving them a voice today
They have been denied a voice
We are so frustrated
Many of us who want to bring debate further on have been left very frustrated, to say the least
A different approach to drug use has worked in other jurisdictions
We are talking about people who should be alive today
A model that saves lives is in place in Portugal
It has taken a different approach to drug use since 2001
Why would we want to criminalise people who want to use drugs?It is like sending people to jail because they have a dependency on alcohol
It does not make sense
We need a different approach
There are elements in this Government that do not want any progress at all
There are elements that want progress, but there are backward elements in Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil who have no interest in this issue at all
They want to see people rot, die and be decrepit because they are happy with the
I call on the Minister to launch a public inquiry in respect of Shane O'Farrell, who was killed on 2 August 2011 in the most terrible of circumstances
Since that terrible day, the family has sought justice and truth about Shane's death
I hope the Minister will oblige the family in its search for justice and truth
It is more than ten years since Shane O’Farrell was killed
The family has always sought the truth and justice
You do not need to be a legal expert to concur that there was systemic failure regarding Shane’s death
Not only was there systemic failure on the day he died but there was also systemic failure before that
You do not have to be a legal expert to look at the facts
One fact is that Shane O’Farrell should be alive today
We should not even be speaking about him today, but there was systemic failure
I have a sincere question for the Minister
Judge Haughton has been doing a scoping exercise for the past three and a half years
What the hell is he scoping? Does he have a telescope on the universe? This thing is going on forever for the family
The Minister’s predecessor, Deputy Heather Humphreys, said seven months ago that the scoping exercise would be completed soon
Is it on the Minister’s desk?
Deputy McEntee is the fifth Minister for Justice since the fateful day in question, 2 August 2011
Since then, there has been an internal investigation into what happened — an internal Garda inquiry into the systemic failures
It was quashed subsequently, which throws up more questions than ever before on the events surrounding Shane’s death
Many people watching this debate will be asking what happened
Why, in the circumstances, was Shane O’Farrell failed by the justice system? I respectfully put it to the Minister that only a public inquiry will result in the truth and justice the family is seeking
Has the Minister any indication as to when the report will be finished?

In light of the report in
This is certainly a detailed and technical Bill
There is a consensus that it will be supported and that disability services need to be reformed
The question is whether it will improve services for those who are in the disability services, their families and all of the workers who provide this very important service
The question is whether it makes the service better because it is reporting to two Ministers, given it has gone from the Minister for Justice to the Minister for Health and the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, or that is my understanding and I stand to be corrected if I am wrong on that
As I said, this is about improving services in regard to disability, intervention and resources
Last year, a community-based service, St
John of God’s, was in serious difficulty; in fact, it was in so much difficulty there was talk of the liquidation of the service
I used to work with St
John of God’s a long time ago
It is a great service that provides a community-based service and a day service
My former workmates were very concerned and are still concerned about the future of St
John of God’s because there was an enormous deficit of up to €35 million
The service cannot be run if it is constantly having to think about deficits – it just cannot have that
People cannot run a service when they are talking about liquidation and not being able to fund the service
That has to be addressed in a serious way
When we talk about public health in regard to community-based services, I have an issue as to why it is kind of NGOed out
I do not understand that
Even though St
John of God’s, Stewarts and all of those services provide an amazing service, they should not have a situation where funding is a serious issue
Community-based disability services have a chequered history in this country
People were institutionalised, marginalised and stigmatised
Gladly, we have moved on
It is not perfect by any means but services have got better and people have gone from that kind of institutionalised setting to a more community-based setting and they have rights
For a long time, people with disabilities were marginalised
They faced poverty, deprivation and unemployment, and they were completely marginalised
That has improved, although it is not perfect by any means
Hopefully, this new formalisation will mean things improve for everybody, not only those who are living with a disability but also their families and the workers who provide a very good service
At the heart of disability is that somebody should not be handicapped by that term and they should have a fulfilled life, like anybody else
That is what this holistic approach is about
Anybody could be in this situation
We want to improve life for those with a disability in regard to all of the things which we sometimes take for granted
I wish the Minister of State the best in regard to this new arrangement
It is not perfect by any means
I could go on about assessment of needs and the horror stories around that, where people have to approach Deputies
As I said to the Minister of State before, if families and parents are approaching Deputies, we know there is something really wrong because we are the last people they should be talking to
I wish the Minister of State the best
I wish to raise the serious consequences for everybody in respect of cancer care in Ireland
Obviously, because of the pandemic and its consequences, cancer care in the context of diagnosis, early treatment and early intervention has been severely curtailed
In fact, according to some experts on cancer, there could be a five- to ten-year tailback in early intervention
This is very serious for those who want to get screened and so forth
What is this Administration doing at present to address those issues in cancer care?
I am sure the Minister will agree that many of the allegations of the Women of Honour relate to incidents that are heinous in nature
Women have been subjected to gross violations
A culture of sexism is absolutely unacceptable in any workplace
This cannot be seen in isolation; it must be seen as society-wide and in the context of how sexism and misogyny circulate in society
When women come forward, they do so to challenge terrible historical and present abuses
We have seen that through the #MeToo movement, whereby women across the world challenge terrible sexism and violations committed against them
There is an obligation on the State to investigate the allegations of the Women of Honour
That is most important
There needs to be rigorous scrutiny in that regard
That can be done only through a public inquiry
That is what the women want
They are the most important voice in this debate
The independent review, as far as I understand, cannot compel witnesses to testify - the Minister might correct me if I am wrong on that - which means that it brings on a different definition
There was no consultation with the Women of Honour on the terms of reference of the review
They were largely ignored, which is very unfortunate
The women at the heart of this discussion were not consulted on those terms of reference
The women said this review or a public inquiry does not have to take years but must have teeth and must compel people to come along to testify on the reasons they engaged in this behaviour
When the report is finalised - I think a period of six to nine months was referred to - it will not detail any specific incidents that happened, which is again very unfortunate
It is disappointing, to say the least, that the review will not make any recommendations on the assessments to which these women were subjected
Overall, and as we have said in the past few minutes, we need a public inquiry because that will ensure robust scrutiny of what has gone on and is probably still going on in the workplaces of the armed forces
A review is just not good enough at this stage
I thank the Minister for taking this important matter
The primary care centre in question was earmarked ten years ago, and probably longer
Deputy Ward and I have lived in that area
The current health centre in Rowlagh is antiquated for north Clondalkin's population of nearly 20,000
More than five years ago, 35 primary care centres around the State were earmarked and meant to be completed
At this moment, however, nothing has been done as regards the Collinstown site
Judging from the response to a parliamentary question, there is obviously an issue with the transfer of land from the Department of Education to the HSE
That may be the case, but the people who are being disadvantaged are those who live in the area
They need this healthcare centre as soon as possible
I hope the Minister will clarify the matter
I welcome the response but it was slightly ambiguous
It still does not give clarity as to when this will happen
We could have been discussing this matter five years ago and the same answer might have been given
I am slightly concerned about the ambiguous nature of the Minister's response
At the end of the day, the people who will benefit are the people of north Clondalkin, who badly need this centre
I suspect that, if this were to happen in a more affluent area of Dublin, there would be a different response

I commend the Social Democrats on this very good motion
It breaks down the stealth charges that people are incurring during one of the most traumatic times in their lives
It is good to see people in the Public Gallery for the first time in a long while
It warms every Deputy's heart
The charges are stark
I am unsure as to whether any member of the Government could justify such costs for someone with a cancer diagnosis
The list goes on: day charges, car park charges and so forth
I received a letter from a constituent recently
I will refer to some of it
It was from a lady who was going through chemotherapy at the time
During the chemotherapy, she got a letter from a debt collector telling her that she owed a certain amount of money and the collector wanted it as soon as possible
A country cannot call itself civilised if it is chasing down people in the middle of chemotherapy over charges for a public service
It is ludicrous
I do not know who makes this stuff up
I try not to personalise issues in politics or anywhere else but Mr
Paul Reid earns €420,000 per year
That is ten times what a nurse earns
That cannot be justified
I do not care if Mr
Reid can speak 20 languages
He does not justify that incredible amount of money while nurses, the lady in Dublin Mid-West and other people who are going through similar situations have to pay these costs
Let us break it down
We are talking about someone who is in the middle of a diagnosis and going through a very stressful time, who cannot work because of the diagnosis and who is now incurring extra costs
If someone can justify that, I would like to hear it
The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, could not justify it
I am curious as to what her response would be to someone in that situation
Two years ago, we were in the throes of a general election
We were all going around knocking on doors trying to get back into the Dáil and some of us did while others did not
Little did we know what was to come four or five weeks later
It really does feel like a lifetime ago; not only the general election but what has gone on in the last two years across the world
It has been a truly unprecedented event, not only in our lifetime but across generations
Many of us never heard of Covid-19 but we got to know it very well in every pore of our society
Many of us thought it was something from far away; a pandemic from a hundred years ago
Little did we know what was to come
The events that happened were completely unprecedented
When we think back now about what was to happen with regard to our liberty, the economic effect it would have on people's jobs, our health, the 10,000 people who died on this island and 6 million and counting who died worldwide, it really is unbelievable
A virus that was invisible to us has asked a lot of us and what we want to do next as a society
In the throes of the pandemic, however, the virus did a number of - I hate to say this - positive things
One of the things that happened was the commandeering of private healthcare
There was no such thing as the two-tier health system for a period of time
Most of the 19 private hospitals were commandeered by the State
It throws a big question into why we need a one-tier health system
We saw the potential for better public service
We saw the fault lines that exist in society but more importantly, on a human level, we saw something unbelievable in ourselves about how humanity can be so good when it comes together; not acting as individuals but as a collective
We can be amazing
We can beat any virus in the world
In our health service, doctors, nurses, porters or whoever it may have been had to go into an environment that was like trench warfare
They had to go into the midst of the pandemic, where Covid-19 was ever-present, and hold the hands of some of our relatives at their very last moments when they had nobody to say goodbye to except those hospital staff
We owed everything to those people and we continue to do so
Hopefully, we see a different society where workers are treated better
Most workers who worked through this pandemic are poorly paid and sometimes not recognised
They are looked down on and their jobs are seen as menial
They drove and served us and did everything they possibly could under extreme circumstances
We pulled together, however
I do not want to be party political about it; sometimes we have to rise above party politics
There were times the Government got it wrong and let some bad things happen
It got some things right as well
However, I think we are coming to a conclusion, hopefully, in relation to the pandemic
My final issue is with regard to a public inquiry into nursing homes
It is really important that this State has a public inquiry regarding all the deaths in nursing homes in the first year and a half of the pandemic
We owe it to the people who died in those circumstances and the relatives who are still asking questions
It is incumbent on the State to have a public inquiry with regard to all deaths in nursing homes
I raise the matter of orthopaedic surgery waiting lists
I am not sure if the Taoiseach saw the reports over the weekend about a little girl called Ava Cahill
She has spina bifida and has been waiting more than a year and a half for corrective surgery
You would need a heart of stone not to be moved by Ava's situation
There are other children like Ava in Ireland waiting for corrective surgery
There is a crisis at the moment in orthopaedic surgery
Even the top leading surgeon in the country has said that the care provided is inadequate
He spoke with huge passion at the Joint Committee on Health last November about children who are suffering unnecessarily
The Government has a responsibility to address this with resources and not let these children suffer needlessly
I move amendment No
To insert the following after "attainable standard of physical and mental health":"by ensuring that they are not being overmedicated due to shortages in staff across CAMHS, Primary Care and Early Intervention teams"B
To delete the words "broaden the CAMHS review to include" and substitute the following:"ensure the CAMHS review is independent and is broadened to include"C
To delete the words "immediately conduct a review” up to and including “resignation from the service;" and substitute the following:"— immediately conduct an independent review, to be published, into the treatment of the South Kerry CAMHS whistleblower and the circumstances around their change in duties which led to their resignation from the service and also into any other whistleblowers in CAMHS;"D
To delete the words "across CAMHS" after "put in place a proactive strategy for the recruitment and retention of psychologists" and substitute the following:", speech and language therapists and occupational therapists across CAMHS, Early Intervention teams and Primary Care"E
To insert the following after "mental health services as agreed under Sláintecare":"— invest in the National Educational Psychological Service to ensure every school has a psychology team; and — support those studying psychology, speech and language therapy and occupational therapy by removing fees for their primary degrees and post graduate studies and paying for their placements"
I commend Deputy Ward on his continuing work on mental health care
While we support the motion, we have also tabled an amendment and it is my understanding that Sinn Féin will accept it
We have spoken about mental health care numerous times
It is extremely important regardless of age, particularly given what has happened in the past two years which have been a challenging time for everybody
Trust is the primary concern of people who use CAMHS services
It is the most important issue when a young person uses the CAMHS services
Intervention and advice are key at this time because the young person has to seek advice and intervention
Trust is the central axis of a relationship between a medical professional and a child or a person in any age group
The situation in Kerry crossed the Rubicon because it was probably the most serious of breach of trust that can happen
Inappropriate prescribing of medications to children is as serious as it gets
Many people will be asking questions, for example, whether this practice is taking place in other CAMHS services
I hope it is not but obviously the review will look at that
The review has to be completely independent of the HSE
I see the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, is nodding, which is good
It must be completely independent of the HSE because for too long in this State the HSE and other civic bodies have investigated themselves
That is not good
Whistleblowers in other areas of the health service, particularly CAMHS, should be protected
They have done a public service in relation to misdemeanours that occur in all spheres of life
It is important that people can come forward, highlight what is going on in a service and express concerns about it
Last week, I raised with the Minister for State a point related to the Joint Committee on the Future of Mental Health Care, which produced a report in 2018
One of its main recommendations was on the overmedication of children
This is a serious situation in the State
If we drill down through that, we find this was done to compensate for the lack of professional services for the children in question
That cannot continue because it undermines the services that children are trying to find
These are important policies that need to be addressed
We all want the best for our children, particularly at vulnerable times in their lives when early professional intervention is key
The policy of overmedicating children is extremely detrimental, not only to the child but also to their families
My question centres on the ongoing cataclysmic humanitarian situation in Yemen
Has the Minister spoken to his counterparts in the EU and have they considered sanctions against the Saudi Government relating to the ongoing humanitarian crisis?
This is the worst humanitarian crisis in the world
This has left tens of thousands of people dead, including 10,000 children either killed or maimed
Some of the pictures that have consequently come out of Yemen are almost incomprehensible
It is grotesque to watch how a country such as Saudi Arabia, which is one of the wealthiest countries in the world, basically inflict absolute terror on Yemen, which is one of the poorest countries in the world, and that juxtaposition of having one of the wealthiest countries in the world bomb Yemen into the Stone Age
The world looks on because the bombs that are destroying Yemen are American made and American funded
There has to be sanctions
There has to be justice and some sort of accountability regarding Saudi Arabia
The Minister visited Saudi Arabia last summer
Did he speak to his counterpart in regards to not only the human rights violations in Saudi Arabia, but also the situation in Yemen? Has the Minister spoken to his counterparts in the EU about action against Saudi Arabia? What is going on in Yemen is war crimes, not according to me but according to NGOs and civic bodies, on the basis of the ongoing bombing of civilian areas
If there was ever a need for unity on violence against Yemen, it is in this situation
Obviously, people are angered by what is going on in Yemen
On 26 March, people from Saudi Arabia and Yemen who live here are holding a day of action against the ongoing war crimes against Yemen
My question centres on the ongoing cataclysmic humanitarian situation in Yemen
Has the Minister spoken to his counterparts in the EU and have they considered sanctions against the Saudi Government relating to the ongoing humanitarian crisis?

I raise the lack of capacity in autism spectrum disorder, ASD, units in secondary education
The State has made considerable progress in the capacity of ASD units in primary schools, which is a good thing
However, there is an acute shortage of ASD feeder schools, particularly for children who are leaving primary settings and moving to secondary education
I am sure these issues arise across the State
A number of families in Clondalkin have contacted me in recent days to tell me there will be no places whatsoever for their children come September or the following September
They have tried everywhere in the Clondalkin area and beyond but as of September, there will have no places available
It is obviously causing anxiety for the children concerned and their families
I understand this is an issue of resourcing and secondary schools are being resourced
However, there needs to be extra capacity for these families
We all were young once
Growing up is a difficult business in some ways
Some of us breeze through it and some of us do not
Sometimes it is a generational thing
It is difficult, especially now
Being young now is very difficult
It brings its own challenges
One of them is in regard to intervention
We say that when a young person needs intervention it has to be there because early intervention is key
Most of us would say that intervention by mental health services for young people in this country is very arbitrary
If one is waiting more than three months for intervention, and in some cases for six months or a year, there is something very wrong
I was a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Future of Mental Health Care in the last Dáil
It issued a report in 2018
Like most things, reports can gather dust
However, I looked over it before I came to the Chamber and one of the recommendations was with regard to the domination of medication as a treatment option
This is very pertinent given what is happening in south Kerry
Overmedication was compensating for the lack of services
That is key to what we are discussing today because there are many other interventions young people can get aside from medication
In the last 25 years, the prescribing of medication, particularly for young people, has quadrupled
That is very worrying
With regard to primary care psychological services, and I will have to be very careful here, they are not meeting the needs of young people at present
In the last year those interventions in CAMHS have increased by at least one third, so there is a demand
Obviously, the pandemic has caused quite detrimental things for all of us
Young people have shaped that in their own way, but intervention is key
Finally, the key thing in this debate is resources
The Minister of State knows that Ireland spends 5
2% on mental healthcare
The European Union, the WHO and Sláintecare say that should be doubled
To do that it would be necessary to invest an extra €1 billion in mental healthcare
The current €1 billion is welcome but it needs to be much more
We will be supporting the Sinn Féin motion
I want to send my solidarity to the Murphy family at this terrible time
They probably cannot comprehend that Ashling will no longer be in their presence
None of us this week should have known about Ashling Murphy
In the past week, her life brought every village and town together like never before in a spontaneous call of solidarity in song, in deep shock but also terrible silence
Many of us tried to understand why this has happened, why in daylight, such a darkness should befall a young woman going for a run
To understand and comprehend, we must look at the deep levels of sexism that exist in society, the crass nature of objectifying women and then some men subjecting them to abhorrent abuse, both mental and physical
The toxic nature of the promotion of sexual violence by pornographic websites is both corrosive and very dangerous
It is extremely insidious, in particular for young men who watch the horrible content that is online
This must be a turning point and I think the Minister will make the call to make this the turning point
Women must feel safe, not only in their home but in their workplace, their street and in their town
They have a right to feel very safe but this can only happen by all of us challenging the terrible sexism that exists in modern society
There is probably not one solution
We can do everything on a personal level, but there is no getting away from the fact that there exists an epidemic of sexism via the Internet and other means that demeans women and then men act out terrible violence against women
That must stop
I wish to start with very sombre figures
Our fellow human beings are behind the figures
As of today, Covid-19 has claimed 5
5 million people worldwide
It is an incredible statistic
Nearer to home, 150,000 people in Britain have died of Covid-19
On our island, 10,000 people have died, thus far, as a result of the pandemic
It has taken a terrible toll on those people, their families and society as a whole
There is hope; without it there will be despair
The pandemic continues to separate us in some ways, but also unites us and brings us together in other good ways
This virus is universal and indiscriminate
Through science, we have found a vaccine that at least stops the ravages of this terrible disease and saves lives but, at the same time, we have a contradiction
While we have a vaccine, many people in this world cannot get access to it
Almost 40% of the world's population have not got a single vaccine
Even health workers in the developing world have not got access to this vaccine
It is quite extraordinary that in the circumstance of a world emergency countries cannot get access to vaccines because pharmaceutical companies have control over supply and intellectual property rights
Many people will ask if this is not the time to waive intellectual property rights, when is it? As I said, the statistics are extraordinary
Even this week, Oxfam International stated: "Vaccines were meant to end
[the] pandemic, yet rich
[countries] allowed pharma billionaires
to cut off the supply to billions of people"
Many people, through NGOs, religious organisations and civic organisations, are calling for a waiver to end the embargo on intellectual property rights to allow countries to make these vaccines
The argument is that countries in the developing world cannot make these vaccines, but they have the infrastructure in India and Africa
Factories where these vaccines can be mass produced are ready to go, but big pharma is not allowing that to happen and is allowing people to get the disease and die
I do not know anybody who can stand over that
I do not think anybody in this Chamber could stand over it with a serious face, but that is the reality
Last December, a motion was passed in the Seanad calling on the Government to publicly call on the European Commission to support the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, TRIPS, waiver
The European Commission has failed to do so, even though two countries who are members of it, Italy and Portugal, have stated that they support the TRIPS waiver
I call on the Minister of State to use his influence, as a member of the Government and a Deputy who is part of the Cabinet and so forth, to push for a TRIPS waiver via the European Commission so people can get access to this vaccine
I again emphasise the amount of public money that has been invested by governments in private companies to research this vaccine
It runs into tens of billions at this stage
At the crux of this argument, because we can talk about and almost intellectualise why companies have to have property rights to what they create, we are talking about an emergency that the world has not seen for the past 75 years
We are talking about people dying unnecessarily while big pharma creates huge amounts of money and profits for its shareholders
It is a binary choice
On the one hand, do we protect big pharma and its intellectual product?Is it, on the other hand, to protect the vulnerable, the poor and people who cannot access vaccines? That is the binary choice
When it comes down to it, there are governments in rich countries that do not care about poor people and never have
That is the nature of capitalism, which at its heart has to cannibalise, consume and profit from a product
That is what it is doing with vaccines
Rationally, one would think this vaccine would be available to everybody and that everybody in this world would have got at least one
However, 40% of the world has not got any
How anybody logically can stand and defend that, I find very hard to take
I wish to start with very sombre figures
Our fellow human beings are behind the figures
As of today, Covid-19 has claimed 5
5 million people worldwide
It is an incredible statistic
Nearer to home, 150,000 people in Britain have died of Covid-19
On our island, 10,000 people have died, thus far, as a result of the pandemic
It has taken a terrible toll on those people, their families and society as a whole
There is hope; without it there will be despair
The pandemic continues to separate us in some ways, but also unites us and brings us together in other good ways
This virus is universal and indiscriminate
Through science, we have found a vaccine that at least stops the ravages of this terrible disease and saves lives but, at the same time, we have a contradiction
While we have a vaccine, many people in this world cannot get access to it
Almost 40% of the world's population have not got a single vaccine
Even health workers in the developing world have not got access to this vaccine
It is quite extraordinary that in the circumstance of a world emergency countries cannot get access to vaccines because pharmaceutical companies have control over supply and intellectual property rights
Many people will ask if this is not the time to waive intellectual property rights, when is it? As I said, the statistics are extraordinary
Even this week, Oxfam International stated: "Vaccines were meant to end
[the] pandemic, yet rich
[countries] allowed pharma billionaires
to cut off the supply to billions of people"
Many people, through NGOs, religious organisations and civic organisations, are calling for a waiver to end the embargo on intellectual property rights to allow countries to make these vaccines

However, 40% of the world has not got any
How anybody logically can stand and defend that, I find very hard to take
I will associate myself with the Ceann Comhairle's earlier remarks on fellow Deputies and staff
They have done a tremendous job in an extremely difficult year
Earlier this year, the Government brought in legislation around ticket touting that banned above-price resales
It was progressive legislation, but there is also a practice going on, which I never heard of until recently, called "price scalping"
This happens when something is in demand and there is not enough supply, for example, in relation to gaming consoles at the moment
The sting is that somebody buys the console for €500 and sells it to one of the high street shops which buy and sell products and which I will not name
The initial buyer gets a 10% premium and the company, which is not far from here, sells it for an exorbitant price, up to 175% of the retail value
If you go online or down to that shop, the product, which normally costs €500, costs €880
It is profiteering and touting by another name
Are there plans to ban this practice?
I wish the Minister of State happy Christmas
I will start on a positive note because we have to be positive during the ongoing pandemic
Hospitalisations and ICU admissions have plateaued or fallen
That is a good indication of the direction of things
So far, so good
However, there are dark clouds on the horizon
You only have to look at Britain where the cases are going through the roof
Britain is probably two to three weeks ahead of us with its booster campaign
The indications are that we could be facing an extremely difficult four to six weeks of infections
Hopefully that will not translate to hospitalisations or ICU admissions
If it does we will have a different situation on our hands
The booster campaign has been very successful but people queuing for four or five hours is not conducive to creating the spirit we had before
People will just not go
That needs to be ironed out
The ongoing public health emergency has been extremely challenging
This is something that our public health services have never seen before
We all have friends who work in hospitals
The environment they have to work in is beyond traumatic
We have said many times, we have huge gratitude for those who are protecting us and our loved ones
There are signs that Omicron is overtaking Delta
It seems much more infectious
I have two criticisms
The first is not an abstract matter
The TRIPS waiver is a mechanism that provides equitable access to vaccines for those who have not had access
For the EU to block that is shameful
If you cannot do it now when can you do it? Italy and Portugal have unilaterally supported the TRIPS waiver but Ireland has not
If I was a conspiracy theorist I might ask why that was the case
Is it because there are so many multinational pharmaceutical companies in this country? Maybe the Minister of State could answer that
The Seanad passed a motion on the TRIPS waiver yesterday
Ireland has to step up and say that we stand with countries across the world which need access to vaccines
On ventilation, I welcome the Government's allocation of €62 million to improve ventilation but it is late to the table
This should have been done over a year ago
Ventilation is crucial and HEPA filters have been proven to be really good
This is not easy by any means
Regardless of who you are, the colour of your politics or what Government is in office, the difficulties are huge
We wish everyone in the health service the best
I want to set out my stall from the outset
It is no secret that People Before Profit and I do not believe in a two-tier health system
Even though we have a two-tier health system, I think the vast majority of people in this House do not believe in that system any more
If you look at other countries around the world that have a universal healthcare system, the outcomes are much better
The Minister of State can call me old fashioned or out of date but my party and I are ideologically driven by that and in favour of universal healthcare
That is why we will not vote for this Bill
It compounds the inequalities in our health system
I understand that the Health Insurance Acts have to be renewed every year to bring a sense of solidarity and equality into private healthcare
The inequality in this is that we need to examine the question of why people need to get private healthcare in the first place
Many Deputies have said that half of the population in this country have access to private healthcare and you would have to question why that is so
If you put the facts on the table it is clear that the vast majority of people believe in public healthcare and they also pay for it
The reason people take out private health insurance is that they believe they will be waiting X amount of months or years for access to public healthcare
That is correct, and Governments have allowed that to happen
Once a parallel system is in place in healthcare or in any area, you will have inequality
That inequality cannot be escaped once that parallel system is in place
Vast amounts of money are spent each year on public funding of private healthcare
This money drifts off and I argue there is no cost or social exchange to that
This is at the heart of a system that has gone wrong
I want to go back to last year when the State took over 19 of the private hospitals in the State
I hope that in the future there would be no such thing as private healthcare, as people having to jump the queue or as people having to seek out private healthcare
There should be one system of healthcare
I do not know if the Minister of State believes in that personally or on a political basis but all evidence shows that where a healthcare system is universal and there are no stages to it the outcomes are much better
The NHS in Britain is revered more than the royal family
It was founded after the Second World War because of what the British working class went through during the six years of that war
If the NHS had not been set up, there would have been a revolution in Britain because working people had enough of suffering and wanted a cradle-to-grave public healthcare system
Many things have changed over the past 18 months
This public health emergency has showed us many things good and bad, but mostly good
Humanity has stepped up to the plate and public medicine has done so as well
Many things have gone wrong that cannot be fixed here, but one of the main effects of the ongoing public health emergency is that people and governments are asking themselves many questions
They are asking what is the right thing to do and what people want most from life and society
Some of those questions emanate from the last general election, which was defined by a number of issues, the main one being public service and our health system in particular
When asked if they want a health service that delivers, regardless of whether patients are on social welfare or millionaires, the vast majority of people in this country will say that they want a health system for all
The qualities of solidarity and equality that are the main thrust of most healthcare systems in Europe place them at the cutting edge
I do not know if Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil can ever change their ideology
I do not think so because they are embedded in the market system of healthcare
On a personal level, the Minister of State might agree with me that there is no basis for a two-tier health system but actions and words must match
We can talk about Sláintecare, which is a good policy, but is it largely aspirational? We will see
We have been talking about a universal health care system for many decades but people will be judged by their actions
Can we deliver for the citizens of this country a system of universal healthcare? I believe fundamentally that Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil in government cannot do that
Once we have private healthcare in our system, we will always have inequality
That is why we need transformative change in how politics is done in this country
Unfortunately, that will not happen with Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil in government
Hopefully we will not have to use or implement these powers
Everyone in this House understands the legislation that we have passed over the past 20 months to tackle this constantly evolving virus, but Members would not be honest if they said they were not uncomfortable with some of the powers that have been provided, regardless of whether we opposed or sanctioned them
Those powers have been draconian in the face of a pandemic
People have lost their liberty and there have been travel restrictions
If we had told people two years ago that there would be these powers, they would have thought we had lost our minds, but the constant evolution of this virus has changed the nature of things, not only in Ireland, but across the world
The virus is on the counteroffensive at the moment in various jurisdictions and people have to act in whatever way they must
One of the narratives of the past 20 months has been that of social solidarity across the world - people coming together and health systems being challenged by the virus
However, there has also been inequality in the vaccine roll-out globally
It is not abstract to ask whether the rich nations of the world, if they cannot at this stage give vaccines  I was struck by what Mr
António Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations, said yesterday
He hit out at the travel apartheid in respect of some of the states in southern Africa
People living in those countries will immediately not be able to travel to Europe or some other jurisdictions
Countries have acted arbitrarily
People Before Profit has supported mandatory hotel quarantining, but we will not in this instance because of its arbitrary nature and the blanket travel ban
Mandatory hotel quarantining is not warranted on the basis that has been provided
It sends out the wrong message to countries, particularly South Africa where scientists identified the variant
A blanket travel ban was applied to those countries
What does it say to scientists in the developing world who identify variants if, just days after, their countries are punished? There are question marks over how wealthier countries have acted in this regard
That is why we will not support the Bill
I, too, want to show our solidarity to the poor people who died crossing the English Channel in an absolutely awful situation
This pandemic has shown us many of the good and not so good things about this country
It has shown us who we are and where we want to go
It has brought out the best in our people
Collectively, we have responded to the call of social solidarity to watch out for one another
It has brought many of us together who were never brought together before
The ongoing public health emergency continues to create anxiety, grief and fear
I would argue that this pandemic raises the question of what is important in society
One of the issues is our health service
We have never before needed it to protect us and care for us more
Last year's general election was a political earthquake
It was a message to the political establishment that people had had enough of the state of our two-tier health service
Almost a million patients will be on waiting lists by year end, with almost 300,000 people waiting over a year for treatment
There are only three hospital beds per 100,000 population whereas the OECD average is five per 100,000
One in five consultant posts is vacant and our ICU capacity  Our two-tier health system has been shown to be deeply flawed and unequal
This is due to the historical legacy of cuts to beds and health resources
We can argue all day about who did what
This Government and previous Governments have advocated for private healthcare competing against the public system
Does the Tánaiste have the stomach to reverse past and present cuts? Can he grasp the challenge that the electorate of the country set for Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil when they said this is no longer good enough and public services such as our health system are paramount? We want a universal health system that looks after people, whether they are a millionaire or on social welfare
If we do not have that, there will be a price to pay
I acknowledge that
It is good for a society to have more capacity, beds and staff
It still does not answer my question of why more than 50% of people in Ireland have private health insurance
In general, people want good healthcare, whether private or public
The sentiments and patterns across the world are a public, universal one-tier health service such as exists in Britain under the NHS
The outcomes for everybody are really good when there is a health system from cradle to grave
A creeping privatisation has always existed in our health system
People are doing very well out of it and are profiteering from it
Does the Government have the stomach to end the two-tier system and instead provide a universal healthcare system?
I did not-----
I never said we should outlaw private health insurance
There are many things we cannot change in the past even though we would want to
The past is the past and the present is the present
For survivors of mother and baby institutions it was a deeply painful past
Mother and baby homes were institutions of the State and the Catholic Church
They were for "fallen women" to be banished and punished for the crime of having children out of wedlock
I will get to my own personal experience of that
There are many flaws in the scheme, particularly around the arbitrary condition of time spent in these institutions
I do not really understand why somebody who had spent less than six months in one does not have any kind of compensation or redress
It is an insult
I am not blaming the Minster personally
He is not to blame for the crimes of the past but he can address the future
My mother gave evidence in the commission of investigation
She spent a period of time in one of the institutions
It was extremely traumatic for my mother and my sister, whom I met eventually
My mother's account was quite harrowing
Her baby daughter was taken away from her and she was not to see her daughter for 30-odd years
I will always remember to the day I die when my mother found out she was going to meet her daughter again
I will never forget it
She was crying and joyous in one sense that eventually the daughter who was taken away from her, she was going to meet again
It was a very painful time in all our lives
In some way there was the juxtaposition of that with also meeting a person who my mother thought was gone; we met her again
There is a lot to be said about what has happened
There is so much pain out there
In some ways the scheme can redress some of the financial compensation for those women who went through this pretty horrible process
Hopefully the women who went through those institutions will have some sort of sense in their own minds that they are recognised by the State
Terrible wrongs were done - terrible wrongs that in some ways cannot be reversed - but at least the State has said they were terrible wrongs and that it will try to make it right
I probably will not need all my time
These are slightly surreal circumstances
Normally, I would not moralise about attendance at debates, but this is pretty pathetic
It is a poor attendance from other Teachtaí, and that is a pity because this is an important subject
I thank the Office of Parliamentary Legal Advisers, OPLA, and those in our party for their fantastic work on this legislation
It is a good and timely Bill
As Deputy Boyd Barrett said, the onset of Covid-19 has caused a light to be shined on migrant workers
They suffered badly in the circumstances and in the environments in which they have lived
The basic rights of workers in respect of what is contained in this Bill encompasses those in the meat processing, horticulture and dairy sectors
The activities in these areas are worth enormous amounts of money
The meat processing sector alone is worth €4 billion to the Irish economy and 70% of those who work in that industry are migrants
There is a big chunk of people mainly from eastern Europe and Brazil who come to Ireland to live a better life and to work
We should know all about that as Irish people went all over the world and were terribly exploited in some cases
Through that, workers organised themselves through unions, regardless of what their nationality was, and through strikes
That crossed the borders of jingoism and racism and all that divides people
The ruling class tried to divide people
For workers it is almost irrelevant what their nationality is if they have a bad employer
I commend the unions in this country that have tried to organise workers in this sector
It is a very difficult sector to organise because of the nature of the job
The main thrust of the Bill concerns employment permits and giving workers a right to switch employer after six months
That is very important
Workers are sometimes in a kind of latter-day slavery because they are tied to an employer
That goes on
Workers are brought to this country and employed for a certain amount of time
They are almost like serfs
Access to sick pay is also very important, as was highlighted during Covid
There was a meat processing plant in Clondalkin where workers were very sick
Some had to still go into work because they had no backup
That is a pretty dire situation
The Bill is really good
It shines a light on migrants who play a very positive part in Ireland
In the last 25 years migrants have transformed this country into one that welcomes people regardless of whether they are in an urban environment or a rural one
Workers were going into places that foreign migrants mostly were not going into because of the nature of the job
They work very hard
Some of them love Ireland but there is no getting away from the fact that some migrant workers are extremely badly paid and badly exploited
This Bill addresses those issues
It goes further than the Government is saying
Migrants have to be protected
What is important in all this is that migrants are Irish workers regardless of their nationality
An injury to one is an injury to all
That togetherness has made the labour movement and trade unionism very strong
If a worker is being exploited or put down, that togetherness is put to the employer
In our eyes as socialists, that has been the driving force of the labour movement
Regardless of nationality, workers come together in solidarity and where there is exploitation they challenge it
Every time the Minister of State is in front of us he is saying "No" to these Bills
I hope one day he will say "Yes"
It is unfortunate that he is saying "No" in this case but he might think again
Sixteen years ago today, the then Minister for Health and Children, Ms Mary Harney, stated that a national emergency should be declared in relation to our accident and emergency units
Ms Harney stated at the time, it "is not acceptable to the public, not acceptable to me, and not acceptable to the HSE" but 15 years on, we have over 2,000 patients waiting on trolleys in our hospitals and, in regards to ICU beds, we have fewer than half of OECD rates
I say this very genuinely but what does it say about Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil in government and about our priorities as a country in regard to those statistics? If the Government was a business, it would be run out of town
These reveal a national shambles in relation to people who are seeking public healthcare
Can the Taoiseach stand over those figures?
I raise an issue that I have probably raised countless times in my five-and-a-half-year tenure here
It is about access to medicinal cannabis
I do not give the Taoiseach too many compliments, but I will give him one
I know he personally got involved in a number of cases in the past, which is to his credit, because this issue sometimes transcends politics
I have some good news
In the next week, three people will be registered and will get prescriptions under the medical cannabis access programme
That is very good news because that could be transformative for those three people, since they will get legal access to medical cannabis via prescription
That has been a tortuous road to get access
That is good news
Many of the people who contact me and others, including campaigners and families, want to know how they can get medicinal cannabis for their loved ones
I understand there are criteria in regard to the stipulations and conditions under the programme, but many people are extremely frustrated in regard to access
Some people have to go abroad and, even worse, some people have to do without
I have seen the impact on people of having to go without, in particular those whose children are in pain
It is terrible
I have also seen how this medication can be absolutely transformative for people's loved ones
I am pleading with the Taoiseach to make this programme work for the countless number of people it could benefit

I will share an encounter I had today in the canteen in Leinster House
I spoke to one of the service officers who I had not seen in a considerable time
He said I could mention his name, John
I said I had not seen him in a while and he said that he had been very sick with Covid
It was very touch-and-go as to whether he lived or died
He lived, but he wants to say a big thank you to all the staff in the Mater hospital who saved his life
It just shows that, through this pretty awful virus, people survived and can tell the story
I wanted to start with that good news story
Many people are fatigued and weary of this virus, but a collective resilience is also going on that has brought us through the worst ravages of this pretty awful disease
Whatever we do next, things hang in the balance
This virus has shown itself to be very adaptable and we have to adapt to it
There is almost a counter-attack by this virus on the world and we need to attack the virus because it is like a war situation
I will be constructive rather than destructive on this issue
I try to be constructive as much as I can because it is collective effort that will get us through the dark days of this dire virus
A number of issues need to be looked at, including contact tracing in schools and walk-in PCR testing, both of which the Government has let its guard down on, and ventilation, which, as many of us have said, has not really been taken as seriously as it should
Even in the Chamber, many of the windows are open
They are open for one reason; this is a viral condition and the more fresh air that comes into a building, the better the chance that people will not contract the disease
There are also mixed messages about antigen testing
There is quite a lot of ambiguity on that, and on whether people will or will not use antigen tests and the situations they will use them in
They are a good tool to have in the arsenal against this disease
I will make the comparison to hand-to-hand combat
Sometimes those antigen test kits are needed and they should be freely available
The Minister talked about the cost of them on the radio a few days ago, but that is open to question
Pop-up centres were very successful at the height of the pandemic
Many people used them and they are very useful during this pandemic
On ICU capacity, I will run this movie forward
I do not want to be pessimistic but if the worst ravages of this disease, as projected by the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, were to result in 400 to 500 people in ICU we would have a serious problem in this country
Doctors and nurses would have to choose who gets ventilation and who does not
That is a pretty dire situation that will, hopefully, never happen but if it does, we do not have the capacity because of the historical legacy of cuts to public health services throughout the past 25 years
When we come out of this, which we will, and we will come out a stronger people because that is who we are and it is what makes us good, one issue will be access to health services
I do not know the Minister's ideological position regarding public and private health services
My ideological position is that I am categorically for a one-tier health system, not a two-tier system or one of private insurance
I am for a system like the National Health Service, NHS, which is not perfect by any means, but it is the system that produces better results for everybody
Hopefully, at the end of all this, we can say our Irish system gives to everybody regardless of whether someone is on social welfare or is a millionaire
My question relates to the State policy that has led to 25 years and more of failure in respect of those in society who take drugs
We need to have a grown-up conversation about this
The Taoiseach spoke at a meeting of the CityWide Drugs Crisis Campaign last week
The figures are pretty sombre, to say the least
In the past 25 years, there has been a 225% increase in drug-related deaths
The statistics go on and on
These people fell through the cracks and their deaths have had a terrible effect on their communities
I have argued many times that policy on this issue has been an abject failure
We have to do something very different
The programme for Government includes an undertaking to have a citizens' assembly on drugs, which would allow a debate in society on how we are getting things so wrong and failing so many people
Will the Taoiseach give a commitment that the citizens' assembly will sit some time next year?

It is in everybody's interest that the environment we live in is sustainable and that we can cohabitate with the natural world and the animal world
That is in all our interests given the damage done to, and the potential damage that will be inflicted on, this planet
We have come across environmental and social issues in the last seven or eight years where young people have engaged
I would compare what is going on now with the civil rights movement in the 1960s
People are at the cutting edge
People demand radical change
They will ask if the governments  This plan has flaws
A number of flaws relate to private companies involved in the plan and to the over-reliance on personal responsibility with regard to environmental issues
There is no mention of free public transport
There is an idea about 1 million electric cars
When I heard that first, I thought it was a joke
We want to get away from car culture and congestion
People want to use public transport
This has to be looked at collectively rather than individually
If it is looked at individually, it will be doomed to failure
It is costly for people in this State to get their homes retrofitted
There has to be a State company that will facilitate retrofitting people's homes at cost prices
There is also the issue of offshore renewable energy
ESB is one company that is involved
It has existed for 90 years
That has to be looked at with regard to offshore energy
An elephant in the room is the matter of data centres
If the projections are correct, data centres will use an enormous amount of electricity
It is incredible
There are no mitigating circumstances regarding how much they will use and the damage that they will do now and in the future
There are flaws in this plan
As I said from the start, we all want a better environment, but we have to look at the flaws of this plan and of other plans from other Governments across the world
Most of my questions have been answered at this stage but I welcome the Minister's statement and his attendance at the PDFORRA conference in October
Some of the claims in the radio documentary "Women of Honour" were deeply unsettling
There existed a culture of misogyny, bullying, discrimination and harassment
That culture went on for decades and targeted both women and men
People who want to go into the Defence Forces will be fearful about doing so in future if this culture still exists
The independent review has to identify categorically what the culture was, what went wrong and resolve it so there is not this culture of behaviour that is unacceptable in any workplace

People who want to go into the Defence Forces will be fearful about doing so in future if this culture still exists
The independent review has to identify categorically what the culture was, what went wrong and resolve it so there is not this culture of behaviour that is unacceptable in any workplace
I wish to share time with Deputy Barry
I am not sure if we will use the entire 20 minutes
We will see how we go
Yes, ten and ten
I do not think I will use the whole ten minutes
This is very profound and complex legislation
Sexual crimes are a very important subject
Sexual violence of any kind is utterly hideous
Gender-based violence and toxic misogyny are reprehensible in any form but they exist and manifest and, unfortunately, they are on the rise in society
The profound effect on the victim is incalculable
For people who have been sexually abused or had sexual violence committed against them, that effect stays with them for the rest of their lives
It will also have a profound effect later on, when they have children, and so on
I want to look at a different aspect in regard to the societal issues around sexual violence and the sexualised nature of our society
It would not be radical to say there are elements of popular culture that are insidious in the way the sexualisation of women is portrayed
It is horrible how some parts of popular culture can be that insidious
An element of that is at the root of sexual crimes and gender-based violence
Even with regard to domestic violence, we have seen in the past 19 months, because of the pandemic, the profound effect of the environment where a woman is subjected to a horrible level of bullying, intimidation and harassment, and, obviously, that has a terrible effect on the children of that person
It is a horrible situation
I have serious concerns about the provisions in the Bill that deal with electronic tagging
There is probably no evidence that it deters the individual from doing other things
As to investment in domestic violence supports, where women present themselves, there is definitely an argument that there needs to be more provision in that regard
It has to be invested in where women present in that situation
Rehabilitation is very important
Some of the people who have been incarcerated have committed the most dreadful crimes
However, how did that arise? Was it nurture or nature? Was it societal? Was that person born to do that? I do not think so
There is definitely an opening for rehabilitation and an opening to prevent a person ever getting to that stage
That is very important
There is also training around consent
We have seen this with the #MeToo movement, which is a very important movement where women have come out saying they have been subjected to quite subtle but forceful violence and sexual approaches in the workplace
We have seen through the Women of Honour movement in the Defence Forces the women who came out and said they were subjected to horrible and toxic behaviour
As I said, this has a terrible effect on those who are subjected to it
I understand this is the most serious of issues but I have serious concerns around certain parts of the Bill
I want to raise an issue relating to the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP
The guidelines announced by the Government yesterday will have an knock-on effect, particularly for the entertainment industry
The PUP has been a lifeline for many workers over the past 18 months
Will the Government review the issue in respect of those who cannot get access to the PUP because of guidelines announced by the Government yesterday?
A number of weeks ago, six human rights organisations were designated as terrorist organisations by the State of Israel
A number of these organisations receive funding from Irish Aid
The allegations made against them are extremely serious and are designed to smear anybody who stands against Israel's continued brutal occupation of Palestine
Israel will continue to do this with impunity and will give the Minister and his EU counterparts the complete runaround regarding its crimes
If that is the case, as we have said many times why it does this country and the European Union continue to treat Israel like a normal state? It is not a normal state
It is an abnormal state
It continues to brutalise NGOs that stand for human rights, and it is also continuing with its brutal occupation of Palestine
I want to raise an issue that I and other Deputies have raised countless times, namely access to medicinal cannabis
Many families and campaigners would have been joyous during the summer when the medicinal cannabis programme was to commence
Sadly I learned in a parliamentary question response today that not one patient has been given access to the programme thus far
That is a huge disappointment to the families that this treatment could provide life changing benefit to
What does the Taoiseach say to families who feel let down by the programme, who have to look at other treatments and who will probably get no treatment?
This matter is not in the Minister's area but it is important to raise it in the House
Last month was breast cancer awareness month
Two weeks ago, this House heard statements on breast cancer and its prevalence
Screening was one of the main issues to emerge from the debate
At the moment, screening for women is provided at age 50 and beyond
There is growing international evidence that lowering the age of routine screening to 40 years results in better detection and saves lives
When Sweden lowered the age to 40 years it saved hundreds of lives
Will the Government review breast cancer screening and reduce the screening age from 50 years to either 40 or 45 years?
I express our gratitude to those in the nursing profession and healthcare workers who kept us all safe in this terrible time
Those in the nursing profession, not only in Ireland but across the world, have never been as challenged
They lost colleagues in a battle to protect all of us
Over the past 17 to 18 months, many things have changed, some for the good and some for the bad
We have seen how the vocation of nursing has been undervalued in Ireland, especially student nurses
That was exposed last year regarding student nurses in a placement not getting paid
That needs to be addressed immediately or else nurses who are highly qualified will graduate and leave this country
We do not want that situation
These people are highly motivated and highly skilled and want to work in our health system
However, they are burnt out
Not all nurses want to do that, but a minority want to leave because of pay and conditions
The Minister can fix that through recognition, respect and remuneration, which is very important for student nurses on work placement
We spoke to them outside the gates of Leinster House today
They are highly motivated and doing an extremely difficult job but they feel they are not being paid for the work they do
All they are asking is that when they are on placement for 18 weeks in second year or third year, they get recognition for travel costs or something
That will go a long way to recognising the profession
The nursing vocation is in its golden age
There has never been so much interest in this country
There is an oversupply of people applying for nursing courses through the CAO, indicating that a large number of people are interested in this
The Government needs to look after them, and once it looks after them, they will look after all of us
It is very apt that we are having this discussion on breast cancer awareness month
This is an issue close to the hearts of many people
I do not think there is anybody in the Chamber or the country who has not been affected by a loved one, friend or family member being touched by breast cancer
The world was touched by the ravages of breast cancer when Sarah Harding died seven or eight weeks ago
She was only 39
It was a terrible loss for her family and the world
Yesterday, at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Health, the national cancer control programme gave details on an overall strategy on breast cancer
I found it very informative
Anybody who listens to it will have found it very informative
Breast cancer is very pervasive in this country
I am slightly disappointed with something that was missing from the statement made by the Minister of State
This is with regard to the age of screening
I know it has been extended upwards to 69 but there is real merit to lowering it from 50
In Sweden and other countries in the European Union, it has been lowered to 40
Because it has been lowered to 40, particularly in Sweden, death rates have decreased by 26%
There is merit to lowering the age of screening
The Minister of State may come back on this
The good news is that the chances of survival of those women and some men who are diagnosed with breast cancer are extremely high because of diagnosis and treatment
Over the next 20 years, breast cancer will increase by 25%
This sounds alarming but it is because of better detection and diagnostics
It is welcome
I have been speaking to many women under the screening age who are quite concerned about it
They want it to be lowered
At present, one quarter of all cases of breast cancer in Ireland are under the age of 50
They are under the radar of screening
This has to be addressed very quickly
In March, People Before Profit submitted a motion on this with five points
These included lowering the age of screening to 40, diagnostics for younger women, triple assessment which is very important and keeps emerging, revision of the criteria for the BReast CAncer gene, BRCA, testing, which is also very important, and an education programme in schools on breast examination
Earlier detection gives better outcomes for everybody
The screening programme is good
It has obviously been disturbed because of the pandemic and everything has been thrown up in the air
I appeal to the Minister of State on the screening issue
Even the experts who appeared before the Joint Committee on Health on Tuesday said there is definite merit to this and gave another critique as to why the check is at 50 years of age, which I understand
There is definitely merit, however, in lowering these checks to 40 years of age
If that is the case, we can prevent the spreading of the disease and help in the saving of women’s lives
I thank everyone for their contributions to the discussion so far
I commend the Regional Independent Group on this important Bill
There has been much discussion of the challenges that autistic people face during my time in this House
Whether progress has been made is a matter for interpretation
There has been a better understanding of autism in society over the past 20 years and resources have been put in place
There is no doubt about that and that is good because it is progress
There are, however, considerable inequalities in the challenges that autistic people face and the services that are provided
That is what it comes down to
Assessment and early intervention are absolutely key
When parents come to my constituency office on a Monday or Friday with issues around intervention for their children, my heart sinks because I know those parents are on a difficult road to try to get services
If they are coming to Deputies in search of services, it means the system is broken
Not only is the system broken, the parents are broken
They are obviously trying to get intervention for their children but that intervention is not available
They must then go through the courts
The Disability Act is breached numerous times, which is ludicrous
I am sure the Minister of State understands the situation is not sustainable for anybody
Parents have submitted the forms and documentation seeking an intervention but cannot get one and they then take the HSE to court
That is a ludicrous situation
We have discussed waiting times
The average waiting time for occupational therapy and speech and language therapy is two years
That is not sustainable or acceptable
I know the Minister of State is trying to address those issues and that is not going to be done overnight but it needs to be done as quickly as possible because parents and children who need the services are struggling
Once services are put in place, outcomes are dramatically different for both parents and children
In my former job, I worked in such services
Once the services are in place, children can flourish and gain confidence
They deserve the interventions
Where they are not made, the outcomes are pretty bad
We want to see progress
Progress has been made but there are enormous inequalities
Those inequalities relate to the very basics
If we cannot provide the necessary interventions, we are not addressing the real issue
There is now a better understanding
There is no doubt about that
Services have been made available, particularly in the past two decades
Before that, people with autism were completely alienated and put into all sorts of inappropriate services
I will not go through all that
They were completely alienated and marginalised in society
There is now a better understanding
The major role in services relates to early intervention
Even if the six-month timeframe in respect of the assessment of need is achieved, it will help
There are obviously breaches in this regard on numerous occasions but if this can be addressed and people can avail of the services I have outlined, the outcomes will be better, not only for the children and parents but also for society as a whole
The programme for government commits to exploring the potential for development of an industrial fibre sector using hemp
Two years ago in this building, one of the recommendations of Ireland's youth assembly was the development of the Irish hemp industry
Hemp has huge potential not only in regard to our climate but also for farmers
There is an unusual lacuna in the Misuse of Drugs Act in regard to growing hemp
Will the Government amend the law around this lacuna?
There is a contradiction in the law
The Health Products Regulatory Authority and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland say there is a limit of 0
2% of tetrahydrocannabinol, THC, whereas the Misuse of Drugs Act says it is 0%, so there is a contradiction
I wish to discuss the pension scheme of workers in CIÉ
A ballot was taken in June 2020 on changes to the regular wages scheme, a deal that would have seen modest increases in weekly pension incomes
The Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, stated last year and earlier this year that he would sign a statutory instrument to bring those increases for retired workers into effect
Will the Tánaiste confirm that the Minister will sign that statutory instrument?
I want to start on a positive and realistic note
The past 18 months have been pretty horrific for working people in this State
The pandemic has shown us that ordinary working people keep everything functioning, whether that is bringing us to work or looking after us in hospital
Those working people want a dividend, not just on a personal note but also a societal note
That is what budgets are; they are a collective action to make things better for everybody else
The pandemic has changed many things
It was a traumatic event, and after any traumatic event people want something different
What was tolerated before will not be tolerated again
What was accepted before will not be accepted again
One of the things that come out of the past 18 months - we are not far from being over it - is that the health service in this country is fantastic when a patient enters it
However, for those who cannot enter it, there is a sense of an unequalness
That goes back over decades
The previous general election was about the issue of public services and people not getting them
Our health service must be transformed
It must be equal and accessible to everyone, regardless if you are a millionaire or on social welfare
Another aspect of the pandemic was ICU capacity
Ireland has one of the lowest numbers of ICU beds in the world
The Minister announced only 19 extra ICU beds compared with where we should be
He said we should have up to 446, but obviously that will not happen
If we continue to add 19 extra beds a year, it will take another 14 years to get up to the OECD levels  The Minister of State's statement today on mental health was quite positive on the suite of issues the budget is trying to address, which is good
The problem is with the overall spend
The historical legacy is we only spend 5% of the overall budget on mental health and we need to get to 12%
There is a significant gap and that gap is not just in the numbers
There is a shortage at the point where people need intervention
The reality is people will die because they cannot get intervention at that time
We need to address the overall budget and get it to 12%
That takes political will and financing, and it is to be hoped that can be done
I know the Minister said he will address waiting lists and I hope he does
I do not want to be partisan on this
It is important that political action is taken and people are accountable
We have all been elected by the people to do our best but also to address some of the big issues I have just outlined
One of the big issues coming from the pandemic is our health service
While this does not apply to all of us, the people who need to rely on public health have to endure waiting times for surgical procedures
It is not acceptable that people need to wait years for procedures
In mainland Europe or in other countries, people only need to wait a fraction of that time
That is just not acceptable
Health workers endured a pretty awful 18 months and they deserved a transformative and radical budget but it was not transformative and it was certainly not radical
It probably amounts to more of the same but there is a price to be paid in continuing this same kind of neoliberal philosophy of leaving things to the market
Sometimes a price must be paid, and this may come in the form of people on the street or people sacking anybody in this Chamber who is not doing their work
We can go back to the 2020 general election, which seems like an eternity ago, when people voted for change
They voted for something very different from what came before
They did not want the same policies all the time but, unfortunately, this budget is more of the same
It is not transformative and it is certainly not radical
Many people will be very alarmed by the news this week regarding substantial energy price increases of between €500 and €800
Coupled with that is the news about data centres using enormous amounts of electricity
The Minister of State can, therefore, understand that there is a sense of trepidation
Energy prices worldwide are rising for a variety of reasons
One reason is geopolitical
Other reasons include deregulation and competition
Competition was meant to bring lower prices to the market, but it has done the opposite
Part of the motion refers to the fact that fuel poverty kills between 1,500 and 2,000 people per year, which is an incredible statistic
People want to heat their homes
One aspect of the debate I want to zoom in on is the retrofitting of social homes in Ireland
There are 160,000 social homes in Ireland
Through the Government's programme, just 2,500 will be retrofitted
That is welcome, but the programme needs to go much further
What is that?
These are the facts
Many people will spend huge amounts of money on fuel because their houses are not energy efficient
Those are the facts, regardless of whether the Minister of State wants to dispute them
Another deciding factor is the deregulation of the energy market in Ireland
The ESB is an incredible company
It was a public utility but, in 2014, the Government, which is possessed by privatisation, deregulated the market
We now have a situation where prices have increased and the consequences of that can be seen
Coupled with that are carbon taxes, which have compounded the issues relating to energy efficiency
That is leading to serious difficulties
If the price increase comes, which it will, most people will ask what policies the Government will introduce to try to mitigate that in terms of fuel poverty
Given that people die from hypothermia or fuel poverty, surely that is a very serious matter for the Government
If the Government
I probably will not
We will see how it goes
I do not normally take ten minutes
Less is more, as they say
I welcome the debate today with regard to the national Youth Justice Strategy 2021–2027
It is a good document but as with any document, its implementation is the most important thing
I commend the Minister of State, Deputy James Browne, on the community approach regarding the misuse of scrambler motorbikes in particular areas
There is a particularly problematic issue around scramblers where I live
A holistic approach that turns an antisocial activity into a prosocial activity is a very good strategy
Hopefully, it works out
I know a number of young people who have put in an application regarding funding
They are very enthusiastic and when that happens, they bring other young people in with them
This all depends on resources
The strategy of dealing with legacy issues such as marginalisation, inequality and disadvantage was not in the document
That is a different remit
Those kinds of cutbacks were very evident in the economic crisis of 2008-10 and afterwards
I believe more than 50% of cuts were made to youth services over that time, and still, to this day, youth services are trying to recover from those cuts
They have clawed back a good percentage of them but there are still huge legacy issues
If we do not have the resources then it is going to be very difficult to engage with young people
Lucan has one of the biggest youth populations in Ireland, if not Europe
This is a huge demographic
There are many young people and a lot of new houses have been built in the last ten to 15 years
The resources for agencies are just not there, however
They have a small amount of resources but they cannot do what they are professionally trained to do, which is to engage with a lot more young people
If we do not engage with young people then the outcomes are not good
It is the same in Newcastle which, again, has a lot of new builds and many young people who want things to do
We were all young once
Young people sometimes gather in places where they should not be gathering but, generally, they want to do things
They do not want to do bad things; they want to do good things
If we have things for them to do, however, then the outcomes are very good
This is seen not only in Ireland but in Scandinavia where, rather than taking a criminal justice or policing approach, the best approach is through youth work, diversion and so forth
That is the way to tackle certain issues around young people
I read with curiosity about the Greentown initiative, which I had never heard about
It is a good critique of how young people are drawn into serious criminality
I can tell the Minister it is a losing battle, especially in the areas I know
It is depressing to see people as young as 12 or 13 years being drawn into criminality, generally around the distribution of drugs
It works like clockwork
These kids are groomed by adults
Money is provided and these young people are used for the distribution of drugs
As I said, that battle will be very difficult to win
Can it be addressed? It can
I probably will not have time to address all of the issues but the issue of 12-year-old children selling crack cocaine to adults is one I and most people find abhorrent
It is unbelievable
I would have known these young people from different activities
We want to do something about it but that is up to the authorities and the relevant people
These are issues this strategy is trying to address
It is not perfect, by any means, but it will have better outcomes for young people
Engaging with young people leads to better outcomes for them, their parents and siblings
The Garda youth diversion project is a very good one
It diverts young people from engaging in activities they should not engage in and is worthwhile
Midnight leagues football is a brilliant project
Community gardaí tell us it diverts young people from activities they should not be engaged in
Engaging in other activities leads to a better outcome
This is about resources
The majority of the aspirational aspects of this strategy can be resourced but, again, is all about outcomes
We need to engage with young people in the right way and avoid speaking down to or demonising them, as happens in society, especially in the media
We have to try not to demonise young people
If people are told they are stupid or smelly, that will get into their heads and they will think that way
If we tell young people they are good and do good things, the outcomes will be good for them and society as a whole
My question relates to a decision earlier on this year by IDA Ireland to expand into Israel
That is a retrograde step
I would like to hear the Minister's comment on that decision
Over the summer, a well-known ice cream maker called Ben & Jerry’s, which is an American company, announced that it would no longer sell ice cream in the occupied Palestinian territories, which are East Jerusalem and the Palestinian West Bank
This was greeted with much disdain in certain parts of the world but with great congratulations from others that a company would take a stand against apartheid Israel
Yet, IDA Ireland says it want to develop its global footprint and more economic links with Israel
That is completely contrary to what the Minister says here every week
On the one hand, he condemns Israel and, on the other, another vehicle of this State congratulates Israel for its crimes
Which is it: condemn or congratulate?
I do not think that the Minister gets it
He comes in here on a weekly basis and says that he is against the annexation of Palestinian lands but at the same time he treats Israel as a normal state
Would he have said the same about apartheid South Africa in the 1980s, for example? No, he would not
That is the contradiction that we as Deputies in the Opposition constantly point out to him
Israel cannot be treated as a normal state as it is not one
It is an apartheid state and that is inherent in its brutality against the Palestinian people
Has IDA Ireland created an office in Israel? Where is the office? Which economic links has the organisation made with Israeli companies? Hopefully, the Minister can answer those questions because if IDA Ireland has created economic links that go beyond the margins of what the Minister says here every week, then it is a complete contradiction not only of him but of the Government
It is
Why does the Minister have a bilateral interest in an apartheid system?

Over recent weeks, there has been much conjecture about possible blackouts because of energy shortages
Ministers and the Taoiseach have said there may not be a guaranteed supply of electricity in the future
If it was not so serious, this would be very funny, but it is extremely serious
One of the reasons there is going to be a huge demand for electricity is data centres now and into the medium term
Most people will ask what purpose data centres serve because they use so much of the energy and resources we need at the moment
That is the big question most will ask
Data centres represent the hyper-corporate consumerism of "you are the product"
That is what social media, Google, Facebook and TikTok are all about - you are the product, at the end of the day
Clondalkin has now become "Ireland's data centre cluster", and TikTok will build one of the biggest data centres in Europe in Clondalkin
That will consume more energy and electricity in one day than the whole of Clondalkin does in three months
It is an incredible amount of energy that it will consume
However, we must ask the question of how many jobs it will create
Very few
I say to the Minister and the Green Party that if they were standing here on this side of the House, they would support this Bill
The Bill is a very reasonable demand and a reasonable Bill in its essence
The Green Party has a lot to answer for
It has entered government and has compromised its environmental credentials on this policy on the basis of being in government
If its Members were in opposition, there is no doubt they would fully support this Bill
It says more about the Green Party that it is not supporting this Bill than about us, given this could have a huge impact on elderly people
I say to the Green Party Members that it is not too late
They could break ranks and support this Bill
I will be sharing my time with Deputy Barry
We will take five minutes each
I echo the sentiments expressed regarding the programme for admitting Afghans who have relatives here
It is a good initiative
Ireland has always played a good role in showing humanitarian solidarity across the world
There are other matters on which I would fundamentally disagree with the Minister but Irish people across the world have always held a hand out to those who are in need
That is a proud tradition of ours
It is very good
The circumstances in Afghanistan are truly tragic but it is a tragedy made by occupation over the last 20 years
We have to understand what the last 20 years were all about
What was that all about? Why was the United States in Afghanistan in the first place? Afghanistan had nothing to do with the events in New York on 11 September 2001 and yet more than 75,000 civilians have been killed in Afghanistan
Ironically, most of these were women and children
There then followed the absolute catastrophe of the occupation of Iraq
The US has framed itself as a liberator
It is not a liberator but an oppressor
It is the oppressor that has left Afghanistan in a pretty terrible state
The amount of money spent is absolutely astronomical
After spending all that money, after all that time under occupation and after all that death and destruction, including the deaths of Afghan civilians, combatants, American soldiers and NATO soldiers, as soon as the Americans said they were leaving, everything fell apart
The Afghan army fell apart after two or three weeks
What does that say about western and American imperialism? There is a narrative that this is about protecting women's rights
The hypocrisy is incredible
Look at Saudi Arabia
Who is the biggest economic contributor to Saudi Arabia? It is the United States
Nobody says anything about that
The situation regarding women's rights in Saudi Arabia is terrible but America deals with that country no problem
The Taliban is in some ways the creation of the United States
From 1979 to 1989, the mujahidin were supplied with arms by the United States which killed thousands of people
This is the bitter fruit of imperialism and occupation
The Taliban are no friends of the Afghan people
They are reactionary fanatics and, eventually, the Afghan people will turn against them
The state was so corrupt that the president went to, I think, Qatar because he knew the game was up
It is the bitter fruit of adventurism and imperialism
We should have nothing to do with it
We stand shoulder to shoulder with the Afghan people here and in Afghanistan
I want to start on a very positive note about the past 18 months, which have been testing to say the least
The doctors, nurses, auxiliary and care staff and everybody who works in hospitals had the most challenging 18 months of their professional lives
They saw their patients, loved ones and family members die of this particularly terrible disease
The public health system protected and saved us and at its greatest hour it saved many people in the most difficult of circumstances
Notwithstanding the public health emergency we have faced, before that Ireland had one of the highest waiting lists for inpatient and outpatient care in Europe
As a consequence of the pandemic, the parameters have changed fundamentally
Those parameters are what people accept and do not accept anymore
The underfunding and mismanagement of our healthcare system has led to this crisis of waiting times for procedures, including surgical procedures, and that is completely unacceptable
We all agree on that
There is a reason that happens and it is not a simplification to say that it is down to the policy of successive Governments
If you look at the policy of a two-tier health system, which we have, it involves private and public healthcare
Once there is that kind of split in society you will have a dysfunctional health system
Deputy Shortall mentioned Sláintecare and the recent resignations do not bode well
There are reasons those members have resigned from Sláintecare and that does not bode well for reforming our health system
Sláintecare was the vehicle for reform and I have issues with the Sláintecare policy but it was going in the right general direction to see a universal healthcare system
When we see waiting lists there are huge numbers and there are people behind those numbers but if you are from an area of socioeconomic disadvantage and waiting on a procedure or operation, the consequences of that will be severe
Deputy Shortall mentioned the NHS, which is a cherished institution in Britain
It came from the ashes of the Second World War
I do not know who said it but somebody said that if you do not give people a health system they will give you a revolution
We have to learn the lessons of this pandemic
The parameters have completely changed
The Government has to address the issues around recruitment, capacity and the historical legacy of those who are waiting and those who have suffered from that split in society between private and public healthcare
I see that the Minister's statement is positive enough
We are, hopefully, at the tail end of this pandemic and I hope the Government will focus on trying to address these issues
If it does not address the issue of waiting times, the political cost will be extremely painful and one no doctor can remedy
A number of weeks ago, the Comptroller and Auditor General briefed the Committee of Public Accounts on the amount the State has spent on personal protective equipment, PPE, over the last 18 months
That spend has amounted to more than €1 billion so far
The Comptroller and Auditor General stated that the HSE has written off €375 million worth of PPE thus far
This is an eye-watering figure but it gets worse
This figure includes more than 1,800 ventilators, ordered at a cost of €81 million, which were never received
These were paid for but never received
We all understand there was a clamour for these products internationally and that we had to move very quickly but this is public money, that is, taxpayers' money
Will the Minister launch an investigation into the squandering of all of this public money?
I welcome the debate on the report by the Ombudsman for Children
It is an in-depth critique of child poverty in the context of the pre-pandemic and post-pandemic world in which we live
It lays out a policy to address the historical legacy of the deprivation of children in this country
The pandemic has done some terrible things but it has revealed the chasm or fault lines in society and what we really are
It has opened up that chasm of disadvantage in how children are treated in our society in respect of social injustice
The ironic thing about this debate is that it has taken a virus that has killed millions of people and caused absolute chaos across the world to have an impact on homelessness in this country
Prior to the pandemic there were over 10,000 people in emergency accommodation
Now there are approximately 6,000 and, with regard to children, the number has gone down to about half of what it was
That is more than it should be, but it is incredible that it has taken an invisible virus to do that
The barometer of any society is how children are treated
We speak for children
We have children and we are the voice for children
It is a very proud thing to speak in this Chamber on behalf of children
With regard to homelessness, that is a legacy that the Minister and his colleagues in the Cabinet must address
It is just not acceptable that children in Ireland in the 21st century do not have a home to go to, but they go to a hotel
If anybody can stand in this House and say with a straight face that this is acceptable, he or she is in the wrong game
With regard to children in poverty, it is not that long ago that the Labour Party and former Deputy Joan Burton had policies which were Thatcheresque for single parents
Her policies have had a legacy issue, and I refer back to the historical legacy issues relating to child poverty
The Labour Party will not be forgiven for many things in working-class communities
One thing it will not be forgiven for, particularly for single parents, is what Joan Burton did to single parents
That is on the record
The report is very good but we see many reports in this House
Some of them never see the light of day and some of them gather dust
This report has to be implemented in full to address the legacy issues
Children will be adults one day and they will go out and work and so forth
However, families face poverty where there is a family member not working
They may be on a very low income, which has an insidious effect on children's educational disadvantage
In a particular postal area in Dublin, nine times out of ten a person will go to third level education whereas for people from another part of Dublin the chances of going to third level education reduce dramatically
There is no difference between the two children living in different parts of Dublin
What is wrong? It is not about intelligence; it is about opportunity and income leading to the social inequalities we all experience
I do not doubt the Minister's bona fides in trying to address historical societal issues relating to child poverty
The main thing in the report is the critique
It looks at the post-pandemic world; hopefully we are coming out of it
It provides an opportunity for governments across the world to look at what they have been doing wrong
They may not be able to correct what they have been doing wrong because of their policies
It is important for this critique to look at a different mindset
The general election was 18 months ago months ago but it seems like years ago
It focused on a number of things, but the main thing was the lack of public services
That is why Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil went backwards not forwards
Fine Gael has been in government for last ten years
That is why they went backwards and other political entities went forwards; they were saying things that were obvious to try to correct
I hope the Minister can correct them over three and a half years
I am not being partisan
Nobody in this Chamber wants us to have homelessness
Political policies are the reason that people are in homelessness, and that poverty and inequality exist
These things do not just exist for the sake of it
They exist because of policy and it is up to the Government to change it
We have debated this issue numerous times
I come from the point of view that there is irresponsible and responsible use of scramblers and quad bikes
We have spoken about this matter numerous times and legislation on it has had many manifestations but the central argument is that the irresponsible use of these vehicles in public spaces is not only a danger to the user but also to pedestrians and road users
We all agree on that
Whether it is a Sinn Féin Bill or whether the Government implements a Bill and changes the law is academic
That is the main point
In the area I am from this is an issue because vehicles are being used irresponsibly
There is no doubt about that but we cannot police our way out of the problem
If we think we can police our way out of it, we will lose
I will start from the responsible side of things
I welcome the initiative of the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Deputy James Browne, to provide a community-based response to the misuse of scramblers
That is a very good and holistic approach that engages young people
I hate the phrase "anti-social"
I try not to use it and instead to speak of a pro-social approach because if using the term "anti-social" all of the time puts a label on people
Young people in particular get labelled as being anti-social
Wealthy people engage in a lot of stuff in society that is anti-social but that term is never used to describe it
It is always used for young people, in particular, working class people
This community approach provides better outcomes for communities, which is the most important issue, as well as for the Garda and young people
There are some great projects around the country for scramblers and quad bikes
When young people are engaged in these projects they learn about the mechanics and how to be responsible for these vehicles
They could even get a job from that
These are all positive things and I welcome the initiative of the Minister of State in that area
When scramblers and quad bikes are used irresponsibly, as they are, particularly in parks and on roads, it is inevitable that there will be a serious accident
There have been some very bad accidents with these vehicles
If we change the law tomorrow, will the irresponsible use of these vehicles stop? It probably will not stop because, as Deputy Ward said, these vehicles are used for other purpose, including drug-dealing
They are not being used for sport but for carrying drugs from A to B and it is done in a clever way that makes it difficult for the Garda to apprehend people
We can change the law but we must also have a different approach, namely, a community-based approach that treats scramblers and quad bikes in a different way
This is a major sport in this country
The responsible use of these vehicles in a controlled and safe environment is a great hobby
If we provide for that, we will have a better approach to this issue, one that comes through the community, as opposed to a policing approach, which will not ultimately work
I commend Sinn Féin on introducing this Bill and I wish the Minister of State luck on the community-based approach he is taking to the misuse of scramblers
All of us want to see the hospitality industry reopened
We want to go back to what we had prior to the pandemic when you could go for a drink or a meal
We all want that and to get back to a semblance of normality but we are not living in normal times; we are living in abnormal times
To say there is confusion and ambiguity on this legislation is a complete understatement
The polarisation that has happened because of this is pretty bad
There was a huge sense of solidarity at the start of this pandemic
People are weary of the pandemic and they want to get back to a semblance of normality but having a discriminatory and two-tier system for whether you can dine indoors or not because you are or are not vaccinated is ludicrous
It is open to all sorts of abuses in terms of medical data and so forth
It is discriminatory at its heart for those who have not been vaccinated or for those who work in the hospitality industry and who will be in that congregated setting
Young people who have not been vaccinated cannot enter a pub or restaurant if they walk out across the street from their place of work to another pub or restaurant because they have not been vaccinated
It is incredible that this has been allowed to manifest itself
Those are the facts
The other fact is the spectre of this Delta variant
You only have to look at what is happening in Britain
Its average seven-day rate is 31,000 cases per day
It is reckoned that by mid-August Britain will have 100,000 cases per day
We all understand that the link between hospitalisations and death has been loosened, if not broken, because of the vaccine roll-out and that is very good
If we open up hospitality by 23 July, there is no doubt but that the rate of infections will increase
It is suggested that by the first week of September, we could have up to 2,500 cases per day
Hopefully that does not happen but if it happens and if things go wrong, this Government will have very serious questions to answer on the roll-out of this legislation and how it was done
Considering all the things we have done in the last seven months, all the gains that have been made and all the social cohesion that has happened, it is ludicrous that we have a situation where we are reopening hospitality
My party and I are of the opinion that hospitality has to close until September and until the vast majority of people are vaccinated
This may be an unpopular opinion but we need that critical mass
Why was this legislation put together? It is a sop to the vested interests, including the Licensed Vintners Association
They want to open and I understand that tens of thousands of jobs are at stake
We all understand the dynamics
I hope I am wrong but by the first week of September, we will have thousands of people affected and we possibly will have to recall the Dáil because the situation could be so serious
Hopefully that will not happen but that is down to this legislation, which is simply unworkable
When you really look at it - and I think even the Minister does not believe it can be done - this is not workable
The certificate is easily forged
You could print out thousands of them and give them out to people
How does a pub scan a quick response, QR, code? Will they scan it? No
It is not workable and I do not think even the Minister believes it will work
I would find it hard to believe that the Minister believes in this legislation
I commend Sinn Féin on this important debate
We broadly welcome the Bill and anything that addresses the spoils of crime, which devastates individuals and communities
The proceeds that CAB seizes largely come from the illicit drugs trade
I have a different view than most as regards drugs policy, which is antiquated and does not work
Criminalising people for drug use is counterproductive and we must do something different
We need a paradigm shift in how we treat people, determine why people take drugs in the first place, address the inequalities in society and so on
There is obviously a large market for drugs and not only in Ireland
It is probably the most profitable industry across the world
People make enormous amounts of money and will use grotesque violence to get their profits
It causes chaos in communities
I have seen it in my community
Deputy Ward is from the same community as me
When I was growing up, I saw what drug addiction did to people and communities
It is pretty bad
The socio-economic aspect is significant
People turn to drugs for all sorts of reasons
There is a vacuum in society and where a vacuum exists, people fill it
Usually, the black market and criminal gangs do that
The spoils of that market are enormous
We could still be having this argument about the proceeds of the drug industry in five or ten years' time, so we need to do something very different
We need a grown-up debate about the decriminalisation, legalisation and regulation of certain substances that people use
This year alone, large amounts of money and drugs have been confiscated
One of the main reasons for this was that there were many gardaí on the roads, which cannot be sustained over a long period, but it shows that there is a significant demand for drugs
In September, I will introduce a Bill on the legalisation and regulation of cannabis
We will see what kind of support we get from other parties
Criminalising people for using cannabis is a complete waste of time
Locking people up is a complete waste of time
Some other countries, including a number of states in the US, have taken control by regulating cannabis
That has been a success
Instead of the revenue going to criminal gangs, it goes to the states
That could work in this country if there was the will, which I hope there will be
Is the war on drugs about containment? Is it about keeping working people down? There are a number of factors, but the policy of this and previous Governments has been one of neglecting working class communities because this problem has not been on those Governments' doorsteps - if someone wants to die, go ahead; if someone wants to take drugs, go ahead; it is not the Government's responsibility
We need to look at this in a different way because what we have been doing has failed
The demand for drugs is greater than ever
Even though the drugs in question are illegal, more people are taking them
Not everyone takes drugs, of course, but what does this say about our current laws? The laws make drugs illegal, but people are still using them
There is no deterrent
That is why we need to do something very different where this matter is concerned
I hope we will consider the issue differently than we have been for the past 45 years
I raise the matter of students who were in receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, last year
There are now difficulties when they apply for SUSI grants
Some have had reductions in their grants, some have had their qualifying income completely disqualified and some have had to defer their courses
This is putting a lot of stress on students for September
What is the Government doing to mitigate the plight of students who have been discriminated against because they were in receipt of PUP last year? They accepted the PUP, and that is fair enough, but now they will be punished when they need SUSI grants in September
I am sharing time with Deputy Barry
I too would like to raise serious questions in regard to the "Prime Time" programme last night
There must be a public inquiry in regard to what happened in nursing homes last year in the interests of the loved ones and relatives and in the public interest
It is inevitable that that will happen
Vaccine roll-out is a logistical challenge
This country has been quite good in administering the roll-out
It is going very well
My experience at Citywest was excellent
The Minister's statement about the roll-out of the vaccine for the cohort aged between 18 and 35 is very welcome
Many in this cohort work in the hospitality industry and could be vulnerable at this moment or in the future to any counteroffensive from the virus, such as the Delta variant
There was sombre news during the week when NPHET gave its advice
It probably shocked most people in the country to hear that we could be facing the deaths of up to 2,000 people over the next three to four months
Anybody would have been shocked by that news
We have an advantage, which is that we can see what is happening in Britain
In some ways, Britain is four to six weeks ahead of Ireland
Its vaccine roll-out programme is probably four to six weeks ahead
One can see the trajectory of the virus
It is not plateauing by any means, it is actually going up and at a rapid pace
The good news is that the vaccine roll-out is being run really well in Britain but the Delta variant is taking hold
That is very important
I have another criticism, which relates to the handling of the cohort aged between 60 and 69
It was a mistake to leave a gap of, in some cases, three months between vaccinations for this cohort
I am fully vaccinated but somebody who is 20 years older than me still is not
That was a big mistake
I know this is being addressed but the ambiguity around the mixing of vaccines as it relates to this age group still has not been cleared up
It is very important that happens quickly
I have another question, the answer to which the Minister can send me in a note
It relates to a cohort of Irish citizens who are living in Abu Dhabi
They may contact the Minister with regard to their situation
There are 2,000 Irish citizens living in Abu Dhabi, most of whom working in the education sector
They have got a vaccine made by Sinopharm
They are fully vaccinated but, if they want to come back to Ireland, they have to go into mandatory hotel quarantine
They are unhappy about that because at the time, a number of months ago, this was the only vaccine available to them
At this moment, if they wanted to come back to Ireland, they would have to go into mandatory hotel quarantine, which they believe is very unfair
I hope the Minister could address that at some point in the future
I want to raise an issue in respect of the programme for Government, specifically the health-led approach to drug misuse outlined on page 50
Previous Governments have paid lip service to this issue
So much so, that thousands of people would still be alive had it not been for the lip service that Governments have paid to this issue
We have to take a different approach
The current approach does not work
Criminalising people for drug use simply does not work and is completely to the person and to society as a whole
The programme for Government states that a citizens' assembly should be convened to consider the matter
That is good
However, we need to go beyond that
We need to take action to save lives
We must take a different approach to drug misuse, because the current approach does not work
It costs lives
If the Government does not change its approach, it will cost more lives
I will probably use three minutes
First, I commend the retired workers we met yesterday outside the gates of Leinster House
There was a whole plethora of workers from semi-State, State and the private sector
They gave their working lives, not only to their families and their companies, but to the State
These workers were well-organised, in the great spirit of the trade unionism
They were the people my parents grew up to admire and who stand shoulder to shoulder in the workplace
That is the spirit of trade unionism, of sticking with each other and of solidarity
The substantial issue is that this is their money
They should have a say in a pension fund that is kept aside for the future date when they retire
Some of these workers do not get any State pension and are reliant on this occupational scheme for their income
This Bill provides that they will be consulted in regard to any change
It seems democratic and simple, but that is obviously not the case
We have a situation where former Ministers get very handsome pensions
However, if there was a situation where their pensions went down or they were not consulted, they would be up in arms
Some of the pensions Ministers have gotten are absurd
It is quite sickening
Some of them are on €160,000 per year
Some of the pension payments Deputies get are unbelievable, while working people, who have worked for decades, are on a very ordinary pension
This Bill wants to change that
The spirit of the Bill is in the great tradition of decent pay and conditions
It is for the future generation
There are people who do not think of their futures in terms of pensions
That is the key issue
This generation wants to look out for the next generation in the case of pensions, the provision of pensions and democratic control around their money
We have to think about this
It is their money that they have worked so hard for but they do not have a say
In the spirit of democracy, trade unionism and of workers sticking together, it is imperative this Bill goes through without the amendment
I want to ask the Minister his views on the recent assault on Gaza that left more than 60 children dead
What does the Government intend to do regarding the impact of this terrible conflict on the Palestinian people, particularly children?
I want to give an example of the murderous intent of the Israeli Government
There is a project in Palestine called the Better Learning Programme, which is funded by the Irish taxpayer and the Norwegian Refugee Council
Eleven children participating in that programme were murdered in May, most of them in their homes
I do not know how the Minister and his counterparts can stand over, and even legitimise, the state of Israel when it conducts murderous bombings of innocent people
It is incredible that the Minister can stand here and say he does not see how a policy of sanction against Israel could be worthwhile
I find that absolutely incredible
Would he have said the same in the 1980s when apartheid in South Africa was at its height? I know he would not have done so
Why does he say it now when there is apartheid in Israel and that state has murdered not only the children in the recent conflict but thousands of children over the past 40 years?
Has there been any sanction against Israel for what it did in Gaza in May? Was there any punishment imposed or any effort to secure accountability? Was there any kind of sanction in regard to the economic and trade agreement between Israel and the EU, which is worth tens of billions of euro per year? I already know the answer is "No"
There has been no sanction or punishment
The innocent people of Palestine suffer while other people pay lip service to what is happening
The Minister must go back and say to his EU counterparts that Israel is not a normal state but an apartheid one that lives on violence and fear
If there is no sanction or punishment, Israel will continue to do this and we will still be having this conversation
The only way Israel will come to heel is when it is punished economically and legally
That is mild
That is very mild

I welcome the statement of the Minister
It was robust
People Before Profit express our solidarity with the LGBT community not only in Hungary but across the world and in Ireland
Given that it is Pride week, it is very relevant
At one stage, people not only in Ireland were hounded, marginalised and put in situations where it was extremely difficult for them
In our organisation we hold solidarity against these particularly draconian laws, which are the anti-gay laws, in Hungary
Orbán has history in this
He has introduced laws against immigrants and against workers to cause division
This is not in isolation
The far right in this country have tried to do the same to malign people of different sexual orientation
This should never be accepted and we stand shoulder to shoulder with the LGBT community in Hungary at this time
I commend Damien Duff and Richie Sadlier on their critique of UEFA's decision regarding the football match in Munich
We have all enjoyed football over the past seven days, but UEFA's decision was unforgivable and spineless in terms of standing up for human rights, as the Minister said
At this particular juncture, when people are coming together in football terms, it has shown a lack of solidarity for people who are trying to get basic human rights in Hungary

I want to raise an issue I have raised numerous times with the Tánaiste and his colleagues, and one which is also in the programme for Government, namely the commitment to the medical cannabis access programme
Obviously there was good news in January from the Minister for Health that the funding would be obtained via the HSE service plan
Will the Tánaiste give campaigners a commitment on when the programme will be rolled out because this campaign has gone on far too long? Families in desperate situations have gone through a licensing system which is very cumbersome and bureaucratic and does not really work
If this programme gets up and running, medical cannabis products may be issued under prescription for the first time
It would give hope to the people who have been campaigning on this issue for the last five years
I want to start on a very positive note on the vaccine roll-out
The uptake of the vaccine has been very good and logistically it has gone very well also
There will be kinks and vulnerabilities in its implementation
One of the vulnerabilities is the cohort of those aged over 60
A cohort of nearly 450,000 is in that bracket
It seems counter-intuitive that those people have been left vulnerable
For example, I will be fully vaccinated by next week but somebody that is 20 years older than me will possibly not be fully vaccinated for another five weeks
How concerned is the Tánaiste and what will the Government do to try to address the anomaly and the vulnerability relating to that cohort?
We have had debate on disability services and the knock-on effect of the pandemic on them many times in the past 17 or 18 months
It has been a grim 18 months for society as a whole but, in other ways, it has been enlightening to see people pulling together in a time of need
I am proud of this country's spirit
We are in a different place now to where we were in January or the previous March and April
Images stick in my mind of really stressed parents
The routine that they had with their children disappeared overnight
That has had a detrimental effect not only on the children's lives but also on family life
The good news is that educational and care settings have largely been reopened
That is testament to the amazing staff who work in these facilities
They really are heroes
They have kept things open and going
They have an amazing relationship with the people who use their services and their families
That has been really good
The loss of those routines has led to regression, however, while the lack of peer-to-peer interaction has had a major effect on the family lives of the children in question
In previous years, there have been issues with the July provision and its roll-out
Hopefully, it will have a better run-in next month
It is a vital service of which people are appreciative
There have been issues with access and so forth
The long-term effects of the pandemic will probably live on for a considerable time
It has shown the grave inequalities in certain areas in society and the fault lines which exist in the provision of some disability services
From my experience, I know this has a significant effect on families in that when they need an intervention it is not there
Of the several things which must come out of the pandemic, we need to address the inequalities in the provision of special education, as well as the knock-on effect with what has happened over the past 17 months
Those who keep the show on the road have been amazing
They have kept the flag flying in the most adverse circumstances
They are heroes and I commend them fully
My question refers to the ongoing GSOC investigation into the death of George Nkencho
Will the Minister examine the possibility of a public inquiry into his death?
I thank the Minister for her statement
I appreciate that she cannot give a positive or conclusive answer about the ongoing GSOC investigation but the family have called for a public inquiry into the death of their son
The Minister will acknowledge that some of the vitriol and toxic messaging about George's death and the incidents around it, particularly on social media, has been absolutely horrible and horrifying for the family
Some of the stuff that has been said about that family is utterly reprehensible
It is terrible
The least the family deserve is a public inquiry into George's death
Whatever the conclusion of the GSOC investigation, that is the least they deserve
I welcome that
To give an overview of the history of GSOC, many people have found the GSOC model and its findings to be unsatisfactory because it is essentially the police investigating the police in this circumstance and in other situations where lethal force was used by the police
There must be a public inquiry into this matter and there has to be accountability and transparency, not only for the Nkencho family, their supporters and friends, but for the community as a whole
What played out on that day was absolutely unacceptable
There must be an inquiry into the incident that happened at the end of December

This segment is about promised legislation
What I will ask the Tánaiste today was promised and was legislated for but it was never implemented
The Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act dates back to December 2015
This was welcome legislation that replaced antiquated laws around the wards of court
Incredibly, after five and a half years, it has not been implemented
Things work slowly in the Chamber but this is incredibly slow
Why has there been such a delay and when will the Act be implemented replacing the antiquated laws around wards of court?
I want to focus on children and young people in the context of the public health emergency we have gone through
It has had a terrible effect on that cohort
This week's report from the Irish Youth Foundation, Generation Pandemic, paints quite a stark picture of disadvantaged children and the pandemic
One aspect of the report relates to children and young people who have fallen out of the school system and probably fallen out of groups they would have had
Usually when that happens - not always but sometimes - they fall in with darker forces in society
Those darker forces will educate them, but in a different way
They will use them, abuse them and normally use them for criminal enterprises
That is obviously compounded by the fact that the things young people gravitate towards were generally suspended over the pandemic
Social inequality is one of the greatest detriments, if not the greatest detriment, to anybody's mental health
If a person who lives in poor housing is in a situation where inequality is compounded, it can be extremely difficult for their well-being and health
That is one thing we must address
Since 2010, the cuts to youth services have been enormous although they have been addressed over the past couple of years
That has had a hugely detrimental effect on communities that engage with young people
It is important not to malign or alienate young people
We must be very proactive with them
We must be positive with them because sometimes society is very negative about young people
It makes it seem like young people are the cause of everything
We were all young people at one time and we all did certain stupid things we probably regretted in later years but that is the whole idea of growing up
It is important we give the positive aspects of well-being
There is an issue around young people who fall through the cracks
All the systems they have are gone
It is really important for the Government to address that
If the Minister of State wants to see what is wrong with the housing policies of successive Governments, he need only look at the recent media reports of vulture funds, cuckoo funds, financial institutions or whatever one wants to call them buying up tracts of housing
They come to Ireland for one purpose only, and that is to make profits at the expense of first-time buyers, renters and the citizens of this country who want to find a home
Mullen Park in Maynooth was just one incident
In Lucan in my constituency, 400 homes have been bought by a vulture fund
This denies people who want to buy a home and settle in a community
To make matters worse, these vulture funds are paying no tax whatsoever
That concept was created by the Fine Gael Government
There is a perfect storm of policy and the ongoing homeless crisis
People will scratch their heads and ask how a Government that has been in power since 2011, and was in power previously, has got housing so wrong
There is plenty of money to throw at housing, but it is going to the wrong places, and thousands of people are still in emergency accommodation
These financial institutions, which is the posh name for the cuckoo funds, serve one purpose only, that being, to serve their shareholders rather than people who want to rent or buy
I will take the Minister of State back to February 2020 when there was a general election and a political earthquake
One of the main reasons for that earthquake was housing
Some people had homes and so forth, but they had a considerable amount of empathy for those who could not find homes or were being rented out of the market
Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil were punished for that
I will give the Minister of State some free advice
If the Government does not address the situation in the remaining four years of its tenure, it will fry politically because of it
The people of this country will never forgive the Government
They will punish the Government at the ballot box if it does not sort this situation
It is completely unacceptable that so many people are homeless in this State, which is one of the richest states in the world and in which people cannot even rent a home
People who have good wages and are on good salaries cannot even buy a home
There is something fundamentally wrong with the policy of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil
That policy is looking to the free market all the time
There is an answer to this
The answer is to build homes on public land and build them for people rather than for profits
As I said, these vulture funds are here for one reason and one reason only
They do not serve any other purpose
Their purpose stems from a policy the Government introduced
They are not wanted here
Nobody wants them and they should be gone forever
That is free advice for the Minister of State
He has four years to get it right
I welcome the Minister's statement
Every time he makes a statement on the roll-out of the vaccine it is positive and we have this terrible pandemic on the retreat
I got my vaccine yesterday
It was a great experience in Citywest
I was a little emotional about it because the last 15 months have been extremely difficult for a lot of people in this country
There is a huge collective effort to vaccinate people and I commend everybody involved in the programme
We are all so grateful for the roll-out of the vaccine and I hope it is a great success
Hopefully, in the next few months, the vast majority of people will have taken the vaccine if they want it
I have a number of questions about things happening outside Ireland
A study done by the People's Vaccine Alliance showed that in the last 15 months, nine individuals have become billionaires because of the roll-out of the vaccine
Oxfam, which is a very respected NGO, also commented that pharmaceutical firms are creating a monopoly with the control of vaccines during the pandemic
Five of those individuals are from a company called Moderna
The vast majority of the moneys given to Moderna were public funds
It is sickening that companies and individuals are making huge amounts of money from this vaccine
The combined wealth of those five individuals would vaccinate 800 million people
There is a disparity and inequality between the vaccine roll-outs throughout the world
The Government recently gave allocations of money to the Covid-19 Vaccines Global Access programme, COVAX
Can that be reviewed to give substantially more money? If we have access to vaccines in future can we give them to the programme? Would the Government consider putting a special solidarity tax on the profits of some of the companies that have greatly benefited from the Covid vaccine and are based in Ireland?
My question refers to the commitment in the programme for Government to phase out direct provision
As the Minister will know, direct provision has existed in this country for more than 20 years
What was meant to be a temporary solution has become permanent, with devastating consequences for those in direct provision
I would like to hear the Minister's answer to this question
I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply
I welcome the Government's commitment to phase out direct provision, which as I have said previously, has been a cruel system for those seeking sanctuary in Ireland
When they came to Ireland, they were given sanctuary but in a system of direct provision that sometimes lasted for up to seven to eight years
It is good that it is being phased out
How confident is the Minister that it will be phased out in the lifetime of this Government and has he encountered any resistance from the multitude of civic bodies and Departments involved in this area on the grounds that this may not be feasible over the lifetime of this Government, which, if it runs its course, will be four years? Has the Minister encountered such resistance?
The most important people in this debate are the people who find themselves in direct provision
People have exited direct provision and played a huge part at community and national level, having worked and raised families here
They are a great addition to their communities
There is a cohort of over 7,000 people still in direct provision, some of them for many years and in pretty bad situations in terms of accommodation
In terms of a request, they want the processing system to be reviewed
It is not acceptable that human beings, sometimes whole families, are locked up in hotel rooms for years
People will look back and ask how those people were treated so badly because of where they came from or because of the colour of their skin
The Minister understands the need to phase out direct provision
In the meantime, how can we challenge the processing system such that people can leave direct provision and be able to give something back to Ireland? That is all they want to do

Today, thousands of taxi drivers are assembling in Dublin city
Over the past 15 months, their industry and livelihoods have essentially been destroyed
This industry has suffered hugely in that period
Taxi drivers are calling on the Government for extra supports for their industry and their livelihoods, and also for a moratorium on new leases in respect of taxi plates
They met the Taoiseach recently, but they have been left very frustrated about their industry
They hope to literally get back on the road, but without the supports I outlined, the industry that we all used prior to the pandemic is on its knees and requires Government support
I thank Sinn Féin for proposing this motion and the NGOs that put the motion together
We have had many duels with the Minister in this Chamber about this matter
I have said that I do not doubt the Minister's sincerity in this regard; what I doubt is his policy of appeasing apartheid Israel
It does not work, and it never will
One cannot appease racists and murderers
Even today, the hypocrisy of the European Union is unbelievable
It says it will sanction Belarus
A number of days ago Israel was murdering children
Over 65 children were murdered by the Israeli state
How can one quantify that? At the same time, the EU has a trade agreement with Israel that is worth billions per year, and it is never sanctioned
How is that right? It cannot be right
South Africa was isolated as a result of sanctions and international solidarity because people knew that the system was absolutely rotten to the core
Israel is the same
We must stand with the Palestinian people and say what Israel is all about
It is a racist state and it must be isolated
I want to say this Bill addresses enormous problems in the care of older people in Ireland but it does not really address the profound problems we have in that provision
The past 15 months have exposed the inadequacies of the model of residential and long-term elderly care in Ireland, particularly around staffing levels, medical expertise, resources, including personal protective equipment, and payment and treatment of staff
There are limitations in the model we have
As Deputy Shortall said, 20 years ago the ratio of nursing homes was 80% public and 20% private
Now that has reversed completely and it has been Government policy over the last 25 years to incentivise tax breaks for wealthy individuals and companies to invest in large-scale private residential nursing homes
In Clondalkin, two multi-bed nursing homes are being built at the moment
The model has compromised care of the elderly
I would like to see it reversed and a model in which 80% of nursing homes or all of them are publicly run for the good of our elderly citizens
That is the way I ideologically see it
It even makes economic sense, rather than giving it to the private sector
A number of Deputies have mentioned the fair deal scheme, which has been quite controversial since its inception over a decade ago
Some people have huge difficulties with it but, in some ways, it shifts the onus onto families where the cost has shifted to the private sector
There are huge gaps in the fair deal scheme regarding those who can or cannot pay and the money going to the private sector
Alarm bells always ring when the private sector sees this as a model to make profits, while the State has given up its obligation to care for older people
There are very good, well-run nursing homes in the private sector but I do not think any healthcare should be in private hands, especially the way we have it now
During the pandemic, there were gross inadequacies around private healthcare
As Deputy O'Dowd has stipulated, there is an onus on the Government to call a public inquiry into all deaths in nursing homes
Just over half of those who have died in the South of Ireland have been in nursing homes
They were extremely difficult circumstances for all the people working in that setting
There were times when people did not get to say goodbye to their loved ones
It is profoundly difficult
The least we and the Government can do is have a public inquiry into what happened in the last 15 or 16 months during the pandemic
It is important that families and loved ones have some closure about what happened to their loved ones and that this never happens to anybody in those circumstances again
Over the past eight days, the state of Israel has rained terror and murder on the people of Gaza
In those eight days, more than 200 people have been killed, including 60 children, murdered for doing nothing, murdered because they were Palestinian
The world is watching while the state of Israel conducts collective punishment against the Palestinian people on occupied lands
When is the right time to expel the Israeli ambassador to Ireland? If it is not now, when will it be? This has been going on for generations
The Israeli Government, with impunity, has murdered and caused terror to the Palestinian people
We in Ireland should know
We have been occupied and brutalised by another oppressor
When is the time to expel the Israeli ambassador and show solidarity with the world and the Palestinian people?
Will the Government expel the ambassador?
I commend all of the Debenhams workers who will be watching this debate today
They have been a shining light in the past 15 months of darkness and they have given many working people a fillip and a sense of solidarity
It has been a horrendous 15 months for everybody in Ireland and across the globe
Throughout summer, autumn, spring and winter, these workers stuck it out and stood together
Throughout a global pandemic, they wintered this one out in order that they and other workers can summer anywhere
In years to come, the folklore of trade unionism and solidarity will look upon this strike as it did the anti-apartheid Dunnes Stores strike and the strike at the Clondalkin Paper Mill
That is a folklore of working people who stood up against their bosses with solidarity and support for their fellow workers now and in the future
This is a strike that challenged the concept of workers who gave their sweat and guile, that is, who gave their all, some of them for many decades, while at the same time a profitable company, Debenhams, let them down badly
At the heart of this strike is fair redundancy for decades of service to a company
The strike will come to an end, as all strikes do
It will, probably, come to a conclusion in the next few weeks
Each worker will want a fair settlement, but they all also want to ensure that workers will never again find themselves in the situation of having to picket for a long time, be subject to police harassment and, sometimes, be maligned in the media
It is important to remember what this strike is about
It is about a fair settlement for workers who have given their all in terms of service, while at the same time they have been maligned not only by Debenhams but certain parts of the Government
This strike is important
The Duffy Cahill report, like other reports in respect of which nothing has happened, has been placed on a shelf
There is a reason nothing ever happens
The Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael parties are the parties of the bosses
They are not on the side of workers
Regardless of what has been said by either party, they pay only lip service to workers
If they were on the side of workers, the Duffy Cahill report would have been implemented by now and it would have prevented what has happened in the last 15 months
That report should be implemented such that when this strike ends, the Debenhams workers will get a fair settlement for the work they have done over the last decade and this will never happen again
Most people watching tonight's debate will be asking themselves what Israel needs to do for a country like Ireland, or any others, to start treating it as a normal state
According to this document from Human Rights Watch, Israel practices "the crimes of apartheid and persecution"
It is a state that exists on division, racism and state violence and a state that uses subjugation as a weapon to oppress the Palestinian people
Over the past 36 hours, the Israel Defense Forces, IDF, have killed 30 civilians, including ten children
How can the Minister stand over that? What did he say to the Israeli ambassador today? What consequences will the Israeli state face for murdering those children today?
Unfortunately, I find the Minister's words hollow
Expressing his concerns to the Israeli ambassador is a weak response, to say the least
His counterparts in the EU are weak as well
Consider what is happening with the EU and the deal with Israel regarding economic development
It is incredible
Israel is not a normal state
It is a racist state, and it exists on racism

Today was significant in the fight against this pandemic
Today, the Biden Administration made an announcement, and other Deputies have mentioned this, with regard to waving intellectual property rights
This is significant for the people's vaccine
The EU has made soundings that it will review its position
Given that an astronomical amount of public money has been given to some of these companies it is the least that humanity could expect from them
The announcement by the Biden Administration has not gone down well with some of the companies, such as Pfizer and Moderna
Their share prices have decreased
It is quite incredible that these huge companies can almost blackmail humanity in the war with this virus
This is very important
The Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association made an extraordinary statement today and I had to read it a couple of times
It is urging the Government to oppose the waiver at the WTO in June
This is incredible
Humanity is at a precipice with regard to people getting the vaccine rather than monetising and monopolising it
What is the position of the Minister for Health? What is the position of the Government? Today, the Tánaiste was quite confused about whether the Irish Government will support the EU waving intellectual property rights on the people's vaccine
That is what we deserve
I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, will agree that older people have paid a terrible price over the past 14 months
The pandemic has robbed some of them of their lives and final moments they should have had with their families
Bonding and togetherness have been temporarily stolen but this generation is resilient and will overcome
We will all meet again very soon
My question is in regard to a call from the Irish Society of Chartered Physiotherapists, ISCP
The pandemic has impacted on older people's routine and knocked it out of kilter
According to the ISCP, isolation and inactivity leads to a deterioration in bone and muscle strength and, thus, older people are at greater risk of falling and so on
It has asked for a reorientation of services for older people
This is important
According to the ISCP, its services have been inundated
I ask the Minister of State to comment on that
I am sharing time with Deputy Barry if he is present
I welcome the Labour Party motion on autism services
It is a very well-thought-out motion and nobody could argue with the contents of it
A number of Deputies from Dublin Mid-West recently met the Minister for State in respect of ongoing issues in community healthcare organisation, CHO, 7, which I represent as part of Dublin Mid-West
It was quite a hopeful meeting, but I will hold my counsel
CHO 7 has one of the longest waiting lists for basic services for children in the country
I do not doubt the Minister of State’s bona fides in trying to challenge and address that for the many families not only in CHO 7 but throughout the country
This issue has been raised countless times in my five years' tenure here
I want to go back to 14 of 15 months ago, and I am not talking about the pandemic but about the general election that took place on 8 February 2020
In that general election the voice of the people spoke
The narrative of that general election was an earthquake in some ways and was that the incumbent Government and previous governments had not delivered on public services
When you drill down on the reason there was such a seismic change in that election, it concerned public health and that when people required services in their time of need, they were not there
People had cracked and wanted something very different
The pandemic has compounded much of the historical inequalities in Ireland
One of those inequalities is about intervention around autism and the services people should get but cannot
Waiting two or three years for basic services for children in speech and language therapy and physiotherapy is just not acceptable in 21st century Ireland
The Disability Act 2005 stipulates it should take six months for an assessment of a child to take place and for him or her to get the services
There have been numerous cases, and there are ongoing cases in the High Court, where families are bringing the State to court for being in breach of this Disability Act
That is a stain on this and previous governments
All Deputies have received these very distressing phone calls where families are looking for and cannot get the basic services for their child
Sometimes you feel useless when you say, "I will make a phone call or send an email but I know what the answer will be", which is that person will be waiting probably up to two years
It is really heartbreaking for the families
These families want better outcomes and services
These are very basic things
It is to be hoped during this Minister of State’s tenure she will address some of the very real issues that impact deeply upon families when they need services the most
ASD units have been a great success in Ireland but there are not enough of them and they are oversubscribed, not only in Dublin Mid-West but also in other parts of the State
These units are very good at engaging with children and the whole environment is brilliant but we need more of these settings
Better outcomes and early intervention are a no-brainer and have better results
As I said, I hope during the Minister of State’s tenure when she has responsibility for this area she will address the deep inequalities on this issue
I believe she will but the proof will be in the results
Sometimes Dáil motions can be a form of theatre but the real progress will be when families do not have to ring people like us
Families should not be contacting Deputies for basic services, let us be honest
They should be getting that service in time, not in two years, but when it is there
That is all families are asking for
I hope at the end of this process that families for once and for all can get the services that they need
We start on a very positive note in the statement the Minister made today
Every week we come here and there are positive soundings from the Minister's statements
That is very good and there is no doubt but that the virus in Ireland is in retreat
The settings that have received it have been liberated by the vaccine because that is the way to get out of this situation
Over the coming weeks and months a number of scenarios could play out in the roll-out of the vaccine relating to the recommendations by NIAC on the AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson vaccines
There could be a situation where if the recommendation for the Johnson & Johnson vaccine goes the way the AstraZeneca vaccine has gone, that will change the picture
There could be a scenario where there are excess vaccines but only for a particular age cohort
There will be a stage where that age cohort will be reached in the roll-out but there could be an access issue around a vaccine, particularly around the Johnson & Johnson vaccine
That was in a report today on the
I commend Deputy Ward and Sinn Féin on this motion on mental health
I am sure everyone agrees that we are living in unprecedented times, which call for unprecedented measures, especially around our mental and physical well-being
The past 14 months has shown us that we are all vulnerable and we can be touched by any mental health issue
It has shown the desperate situations in which people have found themselves in experiencing isolation, fear, loneliness and despair, but there is also hope which is the main thing we want the debate
We have seen amazing human solidarity not only in Ireland but across the world, particularly with our front-line workers
We have seen hope, unity and togetherness that we have not seen for generations as people pulled together
When people pull together and there is a sense of togetherness, that is great for everyone's mental and physical health
That is good but we need to be better
A Vision for Change was quite visionary in 2006
It was a critique of mental health services in Ireland
What we are discussing here is resources
That strategy said we needed to spend 12% of our overall health budget on mental health services
We spend less than that now
Mental Health Reform says there are fewer staff working in mental health services now than in 2008 even though a lot of money has gone into mental and physical health
When there are fewer staff, there are fewer resources
Intervention is key when someone presents themselves with difficulties
It is very important that the Government addresses that
Others have spoken about CAMHS
In certain CHOs - my constituency is in CHO 7 - some children have to wait up to a year and a half before they can avail of any sort of intervention service
It is absolutely unforgivable in that children need the intervention not in 18 months or even 12 weeks but in 12 days
Addressing this need is the key to changing fundamentally our CAMH services and so forth
The pandemic has shown there have been major inadequacies regarding public health services and a schism
Throughout numerous decades, the underfunding of our health service, particularly the mental health service, has been hugely detrimental for those who wanted to access services
Some of us may need to access the services, and when we need them, they are not there for us
Will the Minister of State answer a question on talk therapy? It is very good
There is overprescription of medication, especially antidepressants, for mental health issues in this country
Nobody has mentioned social prescribing
It is very beneficial and we should do more of it rather than going down the line of overmedicating people
Social prescribing is going to be very beneficial
On the overall picture, I really believe, for numerous reasons, there is a mental health crisis
That society is so driven by competition is absolutely detrimental to people
That is a political analysis but we live in a capitalist world that is driven by competition, individualism and profit
If you cannot get the resources, capitalism is really bad for your health
I am sharing time with Deputy Barry, with three minutes for me and three minutes for him
I wish to touch on the positive aspects of the Minister's statement because we are all anxious for the programme to succeed and that is the imperative
The positive aspect to the vaccination programmes in nursing homes in particular is very important as there is a sense that we are getting on top of this
My main question to the Minister relates to the recruitment of vaccinators
There are credible reports of doctors being asked for their junior certificate results to prove that they meet the criteria
To say the least, that is most disconcerting
The Minister said many times that in the second quarter there will be a mass roll-out of vaccines and vaccinators will be the foot soldiers in the process
It is very important to note that the criteria for vaccinators that are being recruited by CPL Healthcare, which I presume is well paid for its service, are quite ridiculous
In one case a trained midwife was asked to provide evidence of her BCG shot
That seems very bureaucratic and arduous
Does the Minister consider the criteria are fit for purpose? Does he have confidence in the recruitment process for vaccinators by CPL Healthcare? This is a critical juncture in regard to what will happen in the coming months
I am sharing time with Deputy Boyd Barrett
I do not doubt the bona fides of the Minister of State on this issue
In the time I have known her, I have found her to be a genuine person
However, the RTÉ programme last week holds up very serious questions in regard to trust and confidentiality for the children and families trying to access special needs provision
At this point in time, there are families taking the State to the High Court in regard to the Disability Act
That legislation is breached every second of every day and families have to go through the ringer trying to get the most basic of needs met
It is pretty damning of our society that this is happening
The questions thrown up by the RTÉ programme concern accountability, particularly around the Secretary General and his predecessors
The current Secretary General, Mr
Robert Watt, is very well paid for his job
Why is he not being brought before the health committee? He has said he will do so at a future date but he should be there next week
There is a running for cover on this issue
To give the game away, there was a press release a number of days ago by the Department of Health in regard to the RTÉ report
It stated that the expert review by senior counsel had found the practice in question to be "entirely lawful, proper and appropriate"
It might be appropriate and lawful but surely it is not ethical
Can the Minister of State stand over the press release and say what happened was lawful, putting aside the question of whether it was ethical? Was it ethical to build up a dossier on children and parents in a way that sought to undermine them? That goes against absolutely everything for which those children and families are fighting
Does the Minister of State stand over the press release? Does she agree that what was done may be lawful but it is also unethical?
I wish to start with the positive news in the Minister's statement regarding nursing homes
It lifts the country's heart to see the effect of the vaccine roll out in nursing homes
Covid-19 has had a terrible effect on people in the nursing home setting so the progress there is very welcome
We are at a crucial stage in terms of the next quarter and the vaccine roll out
I wish to ask about what is happening in Europe, particularly in terms of the vaccine policy framework
A number of countries including France, Germany and Hungary are seeking additional vaccine supply from outside the sources that have been approved by the EU
They are looking to Russia, China and even Cuba for vaccines that have been developed and approved there
Has the Minister been approached by the Russian authorities in relation to the Sputnik V vaccine? Has he been approached by the Chinese authorities? Would the Minister engage with such authorities regarding vaccine roll out and will it be possible to provide additional capacity in the future?
I refer to the roll-out of the vaccine in the European Union and the European vaccine policy programme
At the moment it is playing out like a bad soap opera for countries that want to get access to the vaccine
Other European countries, namely, Hungary, France and Germany, have looked beyond the framework to acquire vaccines from China or Russia
Has the Government explored going outside the framework and looked at the Sputnik vaccine in particular? Has the Government corresponded with the Russian ambassador, who said Russia had availability of its vaccine? Will the Government go beyond the framework to look for other vaccines?
I am sharing time with Deputy Barry
I will take three minutes and he will take two
Today marks one year since the WHO declared the coronavirus a global pandemic
Since then, 6,500 people on this island and 2
5 million across the world have lost their lives
The pandemic has caused devastation for many people on the planet, as well as economic turmoil
We have seen the best of humanity and solidarity
We have witnessed the wonders of science and research and development and a vaccine that will protect the whole of humanity
The global crisis warrants a global response
A very important vote will take place today at the WTO requesting that intellectual property rights be waived to give poorer countries across the world access to vaccines
In light of the vast amounts of money - up to €8 billion - that have been given to pharmaceutical companies, they should show altruism
According to an Oxfam survey published yesterday, 62% of people in Ireland want the Government to ensure that pharmaceutical companies share Covid vaccine science and technology with other approved companies globally
Has the Government used its influence with the European Commission as regards today's vote on intellectual property rights? Has it requested pharmaceutical companies in Ireland, which have significant capacities, to increase production of the vaccine not only in Ireland, but across the world? No one is safe until everyone is safe
That is an important point to remember on the day that is in it
The Minister recently stated he wants to see access to third level education for all
That is very admirable, but is it achievable? Covid has shone a light on many areas over the past 15 months
In particular, it has shone a light on a leaving certificate that is outdated and antiquated
The intense competition for third level places shows up the leaving certificate for what it is
It defeats the purpose of education
Education is supposed to be enjoyed
It is about educating ourselves
The leaving certificate has become something very different
It is a points race for those who want to access third level education
Education should be open to all regardless of income
Education inequality goes to the heart of income inequality in this country
Deputy Murphy spoke about postcodes in Dublin
The following is a great example in that regard
A student living in Dublin 6 has a 99% chance of going on to third level education, whereas for a student living in Dublin 10, the chances of going on to third level education are 16%
Even in terms of postcodes, particularly in Dublin, there is educational apartheid
This is applicable across the prison system as well in that the vast majority of people who are in prison are from certain areas of Dublin
This goes to the heart of the class system
I want to speak about my own experience
I sat my leaving certificate examination in 1990, which is 31 years ago
Less than 3% of my class went on to third level education
In 2020-2021 more than 30% will go on to third level education
That is very positive
There are a number of factors at play
The culture has changed in working-class areas, access to education has changed, especially around institutes of technology, ITs, and the culture of the school has changed, with teachers now telling students they can be good and that they can go beyond what they are
There are still many barriers to access to education in terms of income and fees
Even when in that education sphere, there are still barriers for working-class students
On the CAO points and places for nursing and midwifery, the Minister should take on this issue during his time as Minister with responsibility for education
Incredibly, there are 1,800 places available on the nursing and midwifery course, yet 6,000 students chose it as their first preference, which means that course is oversubscribed
Students want to engage in that vocation
They have seen in the past year in particular how that vocation has stepped up to the plate and served us all
If the 1,800 places were doubled to 3,600 places, we would gain 1,800 additional nurses, who on qualification could be offered a €10,000 per annum incentive to remain in the Irish public health system
This is done in Scotland
These are good things we can do rather than continue to recruit nurses from different parts of the world, although those who have come here have done amazing work
Let us look to what can be done to keep our nurses here rather than emigrating
I am sharing time with Deputy Barry
We all acknowledge that the roll-out of the vaccine is logistically extremely challenging so we wish those who are on the front line of the vaccine roll-out well because this will get us out of the pandemic
I raise an issue with regard to the revision of the vaccine schedule which was conducted last week
That was very welcome to those who are immunocompromised, particularly in terms of underlying conditions
Many people had great hope that the revision of the schedule would put them in cohort 4 of the vaccine strategy
I speak about those who have cystic fibrosis in this country
Unfortunately, a distinction has been made between severe and stable cystic fibrosis
Those who have severe cystic fibrosis have been put into cohort 4 rather than cohort 7 but those who have stable cystic fibrosis are still in cohort 7
That does not make sense because there are 800 adults in Ireland who have cystic fibrosis so splitting them into two different cohorts does not make sense
I call on the Minister, NIAC and the powers that be to consider reviewing the position of those who have cystic fibrosis because there seems to be a type of apartheid approach to that condition
Those who have the condition are very keen to get access to the vaccine as soon as possible
I call on the Minister to use his power, as Minister for Health, to review that position
There are two minutes for Deputy Mick Barry
I thank the Minister of State for his statement
This is probably the first time I have formally engaged with him so I wish him well during his tenure in office
We have different views on alcohol and drug policies, but as the conclusion of the Minister of State's statement says, it is about harm reduction
That is what it is about, because the previous policies of other Governments have been a failure
Obviously, the pandemic has imposed major pressures on alcohol and drug intervention supports
People cannot go there physically now and that is causing big difficulties for people for whom they were an outlet
That is not available anymore, and it is not the same doing it remotely
There is a big lacuna in that regard and, hopefully, that can be addressed in the next three or four months
I have a number of questions for the Minister of State about the drugs strategy
In my opinion, the current policy is a complete failure
It is failing people
It is good that the Minister of State referenced health inequalities faced by people who are homeless and in addiction
This is a societal matter that must be teased out
The debate on decriminalisation has been ongoing for years
It goes around and around, but nobody answers
I understand the Citizens' Assembly will discuss decriminalisation
We have to understand what decriminalisation means
It is decriminalising the person, rather than the drugs the person has for personal use
We want to find out when the Citizens' Assembly will discuss this and if there will be decriminalisation for personal use
It has worked in other jurisdictions
Will this be implemented? I believe we must go further than decriminalisation in respect of certain drugs, particularly cannabis and the possession of cannabis
Bringing people through the criminal justice system, that is, bringing them to court and giving them sentences and criminal convictions, is a failure
What is the Minister of State's opinion on the legalisation of cannabis in the drugs strategy during his tenure?
It is questions and answers
I have two specific questions
One relates to correspondence I have received in the last couple of weeks about the frustration of psychiatric nurses concerning the roll-out of the vaccine, particularly for those in acute mental health services
There is no timeline and there is complete frustration for psychiatric nurses in that setting
Will the Minister of State give reassurance or a timeline for psychiatric nurses in the mental health services getting the vaccine? The second question, which other Deputies have touched on, relates to the effects of the pandemic on children
We all have mechanisms or coping exercises to deal with this pandemic and we are all different
Regardless of one's identity, we all have a sense of anxiety in relation to what has happened and what will come
This has a particularly detrimental effect on children because of the lack of school, everyday routines and so forth
What new resources will the Minister of State put into CAMHS in the short and medium term?
It will be questions and answers
I welcome last night's news about the funding for and the establishment of the medical cannabis access programme
I presume over the next few months we will have a discussion about the roll-out of that programme
Over the weekend, a number of the Minister's Cabinet colleagues were somewhat contrite about the public health advice given in late November
Does the Minister bear responsibility for the circumstances in which the State is now?
Today, the Department of Health announced the commencement of and the funding for the medical cannabis access programme under the HSE service plan
It is very welcome, after five years of campaigning by parents and others
It has been a very long road and finally, this year, people will get medical cannabis products under prescription
The confinement to three conditions is very restrictive
Many people who suffer from chronic pain seek alternatives in medical cannabis
Will they be included? What is the funding model for the access programme? Will people really get access? The licensing system that has been in place for the past four years is extremely bureaucratic and reimbursement is completely arbitrary
These are the most important issues for parents and individuals who seek access to medical cannabis
I wish the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and all the staff who operate the building a happy new year
They have been stalwart last year and this year, and I wish them well
A month ago, Ireland had one of the lowest rates of Covid-19 in Europe
That has utterly changed
Ireland now has one of the highest infection rates in the world
As the Chief Medical Officer has said, the pandemic is out of control
I argue that this stems from decisions made in early December to open the economy and lift restrictions
That has come back to haunt the Government
It has put our health service, members of the public and our healthcare workers at enormous risk in their workplaces
Mandatory quarantine has never even been proposed by this Government
Those coming into the country were not even tested until two weeks ago, and nobody was quarantined
There are, therefore, huge question marks over the living with Covid strategy
The yo-yo effect of constant lockdowns will demoralise and break people financially, physically and mentally
The zero-Covid strategy, which isolates this terrible virus, is a better approach than the living with Covid strategy
We have paid the price for the constant lockdowns and the living with Covid strategy
We have the vaccine, and that has given a huge amount of hope to everybody facing this pandemic
However, I return to the issues of policy and the decisions that this Government has made over the past nine months
Of course this pandemic is difficult
No government in the world could have been prepared for the ravages of it but the policy and strategy, particularly putting the interests of business before those of public health, has come back to haunt this Government
This Government will have to face up to that legacy and soul searching must be done
The living with Covid strategy and the constant yo-yoing do not work
Last November, I questioned the Minister on the cost of private hospitals to the State
He was quite honest about it
He said things would be done differently if we all had hindsight
Last year, the State paid €115 million per month for private hospitals, the equivalent of one third of €1 billion
That is to Larry Goodman and Denis O'Brien
The Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, stated today that all private hospitals should be nationalised immediately because of the emergency
There is a new agreement with private hospitals that up to 30% of their capacity will be taken
We should not be negotiating prices about private hospitals
Instead, we should be commandeering them for this public health emergency
Does the Minister stand by what he said in November about private hospitals, namely, that there should be oversight and things done differently?
Those who saw the images a number of days ago from Britain of Margaret Keenan being the first person in the world to get the vaccine for Covid-19 would have been heartened because the past nine months have been very dark for everybody on the planet
My question is in regard to the roll-out of the Covid-19 vaccine, including the logistics, the prioritisation of vulnerable groups, the role GPs will play and the tracking system that will be in place for this logistical and difficult situation
We all understand that roll-out will be a logistically challenging undertaking for our health service
A tracking system of vaccinations will be important given there will be two vaccines
Solidarity-People Before Profit spoke to a public health doctor recently who told us that they will find this extremely challenging as they are operating at less than one-third of the resources and staff that will be required to roll-out the vaccine
There are enormous challenges in regard to roll-out
There is another challenge, which is the fears people may have about a vaccine
There are people in society who will seek to stoke up that fear
The Minister and the Government need to allay the fear around vaccine safety and roll-out
This will be important because what we do not want is particular elements stoking up fear in regard to the vaccines
To return to the logistics, what provision has been or will be put in place? Various vehicles have been identified for roll-out of the vaccine, including GP surgeries, primary care centres and so on
Britain is providing portable hubs to which people can go to get the vaccine
Is consideration being given to putting in place out-of-hours services in order that GP services are not overrun because that would not be good for anybody? Is consideration being given to portable roll-out of the vaccine over the next three to six months?  The Minister mentioned vulnerable people
Where in that category do healthcare workers come?

I will listen to the Minister's reply before I contribute, to expedite matters
There has been a lot of commentary about and criticism of the Government regarding the treatment of student nurses, even prior to Covid-19
If anything can emerge from this situation, particularly in terms of the review, it is how student nurses and nurses are treated
They are extremely dedicated to their vocation
The last nine months have been unbelievably challenging, not only for the student nurses and their families but the people that they care for
I hope the review will identify a number of issues
I was a healthcare assistant for a long time prior to being elected so I understand about student nurses being on placement and that it is an educational environment, but it is also an environment where the healthcare assistants do a significant amount of work and they should be compensated and remunerated for that
The retention of nurses is so important in this environment
When nurses graduate, they want to stay in this country
They are so proud of their job, but they will not stay here if they are constantly exploited and not respected
I plead with the Minister that following the review student nurses would be properly paid for the work they do

It is good that we are having this debate about animal welfare and, in particular, equine welfare
There is no getting away from the fact that equine welfare in Ireland has a patchy history, to say the least
I always come from the standpoint that the vast majority of horse owners are responsible with their animals
There is an element of irresponsibility which is borne out in sulky racing on roads, which nobody can defend
It is reckless and dangerous not only for the people on the sulkies but also the horses and other road users
Sulky racing is a reckless activity for those who engage in it
Most of the time, there are vast amounts of money involved in the practice as well
Coming from an urban environment, there were a lot of horses in the area where I grew up
There was an issue around the stabling of horses and so on but that has been addressed over time
There is a long tradition of horse ownership in an urban environment
It has been a positive experience in terms of the responsibility attached to owning a horse
In the past three or four years, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has allocated a lot of money to a project in Clondalkin known as the Clondalkin Equine Club, which is the only club of its kind in Ireland
It provides young people with a place to stable a horse in an urban environment
It is a controlled, educational and responsible environment
This is a good way of supporting horse ownership in rural and urban environments
On the Bill, when we ban something, we drive it underground
That is what this Bill will do
A ban on sulking racing will have the opposite effect
There are regulations and laws in place which provide for prosecution of illegal activities
It is obvious that sulky racing is illegal
Harness racing is a responsible sport in Ireland
There is a really good track in Portmarnock where harness racing takes place responsibly
It is regulated and it is a really good sport to be involved in and to observe
It is important not to conflate the activities of people who are responsible with those who are very irresponsible and will do as we see in online videos where they are racing horses recklessly on dual carriageways
That will lead to an accident sooner or later
It would be very difficult to support this Bill
Deputy Mattie McGrath's sentiment relates to animal welfare
I understand that but this will have the opposite effect by driving sulky racing underground where it will be even more dangerous than it is now
Regulation, education and engaging with sulky owners is the way to do it
There are parallels between this issue and the scramblers with which we have a big problem in urban environments
Laws alone will not solve this issue
There are laws in place but we need more regulation and control and to tell people that this is a very dangerous pastime for national roads, which could lead to people dying
On that basis, it would be very difficult for People Before Profit to support this Bill
We have clapped and saluted our front-line workers who have been at the coalface of this war against Covid-19
The vocation of nursing is facing its greatest challenge but it is also having its finest hour
When we, as a society, have needed them the most, healthcare workers have been there for us
The members of the nursing profession have a long, illustrious history of caring not only for their own profession, but also for society as a whole
They have seen the terrible impact that Covid-19 has had on their colleagues
Thousands upon thousands of healthcare workers across the world have died looking after people like us and anyone who is watching this debate
The pandemic has taken a terrible toll, not only physically but also psychologically
Imagine being in an intensive care unit, wearing personal protective equipment, PPE, and holding the hand of a person in their final moments
It is truly amazing and touching to think about
We are indebted to the people who are there during others' final moments, because the person who is dying could be any of our mothers, fathers, brothers or sisters
It was just over a year ago that nurses were compelled to go on strike over pay and conditions
Nurses should never have to go on strike but they did for a number of reasons
It was not only for the sake of their own profession but related to wider aspects and the bigger picture of our health service and the direction it has taken
They were fighting for their profession, the retention of staff, pay and conditions, and all that goes with those things
These are the kinds of substantial questions about which we talk
Last year, more than 5,000 leaving certificate students showed their first preference was to study nursing and midwifery
There is an oversubscription of applicants who want to go into nursing
We are today raising the issue of what happens at the end of that process
I know many student nurses because I have worked with many of them and have a lot of good friends who are nurses
They say that they love their job but are burnt out by the nature of the work and the way they are treated
That is particularly true of student nurses in their undergraduate years
They feel used and, in the words of the INMO, they feel exploited by what they have to do in wards
They recognise that they were given equivalent rates of pay to healthcare assistants, HCAs, in April and May but that has since been withdrawn for no good reason and even though they are obviously doing exactly the same work
That needs to be reviewed in a substantial way
The Minister has spoken about placements and education training
Nurses are, of course, on wards and training but they also have to live
Pay of €50 per week is a pittance, and in the bigger picture, this is quite a wealthy country
We should have nurses who qualify and do not then feel compelled to emigrate
Some people might want to go to other countries after they graduate
However, a substantial number of nurses want to stay in this country but feel so burnt out after four years that they do not want to stay anymore
If even 50% of those nurses who go abroad were to stay in this country, there would not be a shortage of nurses here
There is, in fact, a worldwide shortage of nurses
We have to examine that
Why are student nurses and doctors leaving the State after being trained? They want to stay here but are compelled to leave
Covid-19 will be gone eventually, and when it is, we need to look deeply into why the medical professionals in this country want to emigrate once they are trained
There are matters of legacy here for society and the Government
The lesson to be learned about student nurses is that health should be put before wealth
The legacy of student nurses is about remuneration, respect and retention
Those are the important three words
If we can concentrate on them, we can hold on to our nurses at a time when this Government and society need them the most
Anyone who watched the "RTÉ Investigates" programme on the treatment of greyhounds and the greyhound industry last year would have been rather sickened at the way greyhounds were treated
I imagine there are responsible greyhound owners in Ireland who would have been completely sickened by what they saw on that programme
Many people, including myself, would not have known how the greyhound industry was funded
The amount of money allocated since 2000 is staggering
More than €200 million has been granted to this industry
Obviously, €19 million has been allocated this year with additional funding of €2
4 million
Deputy Carthy referenced an article in
Before foregoing the question-----
Is it in order for Deputy Bríd Smith's question to be facilitated if possible?
That is fine
Before foregoing the question-----
Is it in order for Deputy Bríd Smith's question to be facilitated if possible?
That is fine
I will be as brief as possible
I will support this Bill
Fair play to Deputy Ward and Sinn Féin for their work on the Bill
It is important that as Deputies and as a society we talk about mental health
There has been a marked difference in the past five years in talking about mental health issues
Sometimes, talking about something can halve the problem
This is about resources
A Vision for Change was published 14 years ago
The budgetary percentages were not fulfilled to tackle deficiencies in mental health services
The new document, Sharing the Vision, sets out a parameter for fixing the vision
That is important
We have said numerous times in the Chamber that this is about early intervention
When people get intervention early, there are better outcomes
If people do not get intervention, then there are worse outcomes, especially around mental health
The outcomes can be dire and people may simply die
If we can get early intervention for people when they need it, the outcomes are better not only for the people concerned but for society, community and family
We talk all the time about reform
There needs to be a radical overhaul of the health service in this country
One thing Covid-19 has exposed is the fault line in our health service
Covid-19 has revealed what is probably a new phenomenon in human health
Today, the UN said a global mental health crisis is on the horizon or is in existence
Covid-19 has amplified the anxieties and fears of everyone
It can amplify depression, loneliness and all that comes with it
It is imperative that we reach out to our neighbours and family
These are simple things but they can make a major difference
The Minister of State, Deputy Butler, has spoken before about Covid-19
It is important that now and in the coming years we look at the effect Covid-19 is having on society
We need to put in place the facilities and resources that can help people get over it
We will get over this pandemic
However, we need to be in a better place not only in respect of our health service but our mental health services as well
I thank Sinn Féin for this motion
It is quite comprehensive and deals with all the substantial issues in this situation
I was thinking about what to say today and the irresponsible use of these vehicles, which are very dangerous, is a huge issue in the area I come from in Clondalkin
There are parallels between this and the epidemic of stolen cars in the mid-1990s
I am not going to go in-depth into how that was tackled but there is a wider societal issue when it comes to why young people need to do these activities
The law needs to change because there is ambiguity about the laws around off-road vehicles, but we could change the law tomorrow and there would still be a societal issue
Why do people engage in these activities, particularly in working-class communities? They are a huge danger to themselves, as these vehicles are not meant to go on tarmacked roads
They are off-road vehicles
If someone comes off one of those bikes, and these lads do not wear helmets, they will die or kill someone else
There have been deaths and people have suffered serious, life-changing injuries over the past few years
We definitely need clarity on the law because, as far as I can see, there is ambiguity and the law on these vehicles needs to change
Some people who use these vehicles use them very irresponsibly, although a huge number of people use them very responsibly
I am aware of two motocross clubs in Dublin, one in Mulhuddart and one in Dublin city
They engage with young people and give them responsibility around vehicles such as quad bikes or motorbikes
That shows them how dangerous these vehicles can be, but also how enjoyable they can be because once they are used in a controlled manner, they can be a very enjoyable hobby
The vast majority of people who use these vehicles use them in a safe and controlled environment
That is important
The current legislation is unfit for an urban environment
This issue has been raised many times, not only here but in council chambers or at JPCs, and working-class communities want to see some sort of action
That action should be a change of law but it should also involve giving young people alternative things to do
Local authorities are trying to address these issues
It is not a panacea by any means but we should give young people an alternative in order that they can go from anti-social behaviour, although I hate using the term, to pro-social behaviour
We can give them the adrenaline rush young people sometimes want in a safe and controlled environment where they can show responsibility, not only for themselves but for their peers as well
It is vitally important that we engage with young people and look for alternatives to these vehicles
As I said, they can bring immense joy but they can also bring immense misery if they are used irresponsibly
The law needs to change as the police are confined to certain things that cannot be done in public parks but we should go back to the societal issue as to why these vehicles are used in a way that can be extremely negative and irresponsible for the communities where most of these people live
We need to change the law and look for an alternative
As well as the clubs in Dublin, there are many clubs across the State that use motocross vehicles in very responsible manner
We must look for alternatives and work with local communities and young people
We will not get through to everybody
There is an element of people who use them for other purposes, such as dealing drugs and so forth, but we have to look for alternatives
If we can look for alternatives, we can in some way address the issue
First, I send our condolences and solidarity to Saeb Erekat, who was an international spokesperson for the Palestinian Authority and who passed away a number of days ago
Our solidarity is with Mr
Erekat's family
I wish to quote from a statement made last week by the Minister, Deputy Coveney, a colleague of the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, on the demolitions of a Bedouin town in the West Bank
I will not quote it in full but I will quote extensive parts of it
The Minister stated: I am deeply dismayed to learn of the demolition by Israeli authorities on 3 November of more than 70 structures, belonging to 11 Palestinian families in the community of Humsa Al Bqai'a in the northern Jordan Valley
These demolitions include residential, livelihood and sanitation facilities
] The eviction of families and demolition of their homes is a brutal and violent act
These most vulnerable of people should be protected by the occupation authorities, not subject to further injustice
] This week's destruction of the
[village] is a further acceleration of confiscations and demolitions this year, despite previous commitments from Israeli authorities
The Minister further stated, in response to a question Deputy Costello asked about demolitions that were ongoing in the West Bank, and again it is quite a long answer so I will read out only a slight part of it: "The only possible conclusion we can draw from the systematic nature of these policies, especially in areas where illegal
settlements have already been constructed, is that they are aimed at forcing Palestinians off their land
" It is quite an extraordinary statement by the Minister
The photo I am holding shows some of the evidence of the bulldozing last week of the Bedouin village, with 80 Palestinians being left homeless
If one looks at this picture very carefully, it says, "Humanitarian Support to Palestinians at risk of forcible transfer in the West Bank
" It can be seen that the structure is completely destroyed
If one looks very carefully, one will see the logos of agencies of a number of countries that have donated these materials to the most vulnerable people in Palestine
One of the countries is Ireland; the logo of Irish Aid can be seen
There is no depth of cruelty that Israel will not go to in displacing people, which is an international crime by any standards
There is a pattern here because this has been going on for decades
Israel has been clearing people from particularly around the Jordan Valley, buildings in East Jerusalem and the West Bank and so forth
More Palestinians in the West Bank and East Jerusalem have lost their homes in the first ten months of this year alone than in any full year since 2016
As I said, this is a forcible transfer of people who are vulnerable and now homeless, and Covid-19 hangs over these people as well
It is quite incredible to think that these materials that were funded by the European Union are literally bulldozed over and that there are no consequences for the state of Israel
Most people would say there has to be a consequence for a state doing this to taxpayers' money and government money, but there does not seem to be any consequences
I know the Government has issued a statement on moneys that it will want to be compensated by the state of Israel, €625,000 between compensation from previous demolitions and compensation arising from confiscations by the Israeli authorities
There is lip service and platitudes regarding Israel
It is treated very differently from any other state
First, what is the Minister of State going to do? Second, has he called the Israeli ambassador in on this issue?
I do not doubt the bona fides of the Government with regard to the plight of the Palestinian people
We have a good record in this country
Our history is one of being colonised and brutalised and we always have a historical context for supporting the Palestinians
That is great but we must go beyond that
What are the consequences for Israel? The first consequence should, at a minimum, be the recovery of the €625,000 sought by the UN and Ireland to compensate for the destruction of some of the buildings
The second is that the Israeli ambassador should be called in and asked why his army is doing this to people in Palestine
These are simple things
My more substantial question is on the occupied territories Bill
The Government has failed to send out the right signal to the international community that brutality and occupation are wrong
Ireland should stand up for the Palestinian people, not with platitudes or by paying lip service, but with real deeds, namely, calling in the Israeli ambassador, recovering the moneys owed and passing the occupied territories Bill
Will the Minister of State call in the Israeli ambassador? Will he show him this photo? It is a war crime

I raise an issue with the Taoiseach that has been raised numerous times in the Chamber in relation to Debenhams workers who have been on strike for over 200 days
It is becoming one of the longest strikes in Irish labour history
My colleague, Deputy Boyd Barrett, raised this issue with the Taoiseach last week and the Taoiseach acknowledged that the talks in the WRC did not deliver a solution
The Taoiseach said something has to be done
Regardless of political affiliation, I think we all agree that something has to be done because this cannot go on
What the workers are looking for is very just: a fair redundancy
That is the cornerstone of this fight
Many TDs, of all political affiliations, have visited the picket line and the workers want to see a solution
They want to see a meaningful settlement to which they are entitled
Some of the workers worked for the company for decades
They feel as though they have been robbed by their employer and they feel let down by the State
This should never have happened
If we look back at what happened in Clerys, the Government should have implemented the Duffy Cahill report and this should never have happened
A solution can be found at this late stage
This could go on indefinitely and we want to see a settlement by the Government
The Taoiseach can intervene personally
Sometimes the last people to get paid as creditors are the workers themselves
They are the people who made all of that money in the first place so it is a terrible injustice
The Government can waive the fees that are owed to the State, which could accumulate up to €20 million
To sort out the strike would cost between €12 million and €14 million
The Government has the power to waive these fees with regard to final settlements
The strike has to end, and it will end, but it has to end with workers feeling they have not been robbed
That is very important
They should not be robbed and they feel they have to have a settlement
This could go on forever
It is in the Taoiseach's power to intervene in this personally and end the strike as soon as possible
I do not doubt the Taoiseach's bona fides in trying to settle this outstanding strike
The State should step aside as a creditor because otherwise the workers will not get the redundancy they are looking for
It is really important that something concrete happens
We can talk until the cows come home and have all of the platitudes we want but this is about will
It is like everything in life: if the will is there, things can be settled
Things are not as complicated as they are made out to be
The Taoiseach and the Government have the power to intervene on this occasion, because the previous Government made a mess of the situation where workers were being screwed by their big employer
Of course, there are rogue employers but there are some good employers as well and some very good workers
Those workers have been out for over seven months, rain, shine and everything, including Covid-19, and they still have that amazing solidarity to stay the course
They deserve it
They deserve two extra weeks with their statutory redundancy, and that is the least they deserve
The women's health task force was established in September last year
What actions has it taken and will it take over the next three years?
The women's health task force is very welcome because in the past healthcare has been very patriarchal
It has let down women many times and women's healthcare in Ireland must be addressed
It is ironic that the task force was established because it was recommended in the scoping inquiry on the cervical screening programme after women had been completely let down
That should be remembered in the tribunal that will take place soon
What areas will be developed around gynaecological health? Will it address endometriosis, something that one in ten women suffer from? It can take up to nine years for a diagnosis
One of the task force's mantras is that it will do radical listening on women's health
That is welcome
Women should be at the heart of women's health and they should be listened to, where not doing so was a problem in the past
Covid-19 has had a huge effect on everyone, regardless of gender, but I raise its impact on women's mental health
Covid has done a huge amount of social, physical and mental damage
How will the task force address that?
The position of student nurses in our health service is very important
There is a lot of exploitation where student nurses work on the front line
They feel they are being exploited and are not being recognised for their work
Two weeks ago, representatives from the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, were before the Joint Committee on Health
The INMO's submission was extraordinary
It said that 3,400 students are on placements in Irish hospitals
Covid means they are in a vulnerable position
The failure by the HSE "to remunerate them amounts to exploitation"
That is awful
The statement also notes that 50 nurses are infected by Covid each week
Student nurses feel very let down, unrecognised for their work but also financially
The Minister has to address that
The world we used to live in prior to Covid-19 seems like a very different world from the one we are living in now
In former times, many student nurses could take up other jobs in nursing homes and so on, but they can no longer do so for all sorts of reasons
Financially, this has left them out of pocket
Living on an allowance of €50 a week, with the responsibility that is entailed in their roles, is having a hugely detrimental effect on their well-being
Nursing is a very hard job and the people working in the profession are extremely dedicated
However, some are fearful of the nature of the business they are in
It is very important that the Minister for Health should recognise the contribution of student nurses, whether in first, second or third year
Of course their placements are part of their education
I know that because I used to work alongside them
However, it is really important that they are recognised, financially as well as educationally, particularly in the context of the Covid-19 crisis

I am sharing time with Deputies Bríd Smith, Boyd Barrett and Barry
We are at the beginning of another lockdown, the second
The vast majority of people have adhered to the guidelines
They have made enormous sacrifices of their liberty with financial, family and health implications and they will continue to make them
In some ways a second lockdown was almost flagged
If we are facing a third lockdown in February, the spirit of the people who had made such sacrifices will be broken
There is a limit to what people can do
This Bill is largely cosmetic
It tries to penalise people for holding house parties and so forth
The powers given to the Garda to fine people and direct people away from particular areas and house parties are largely cosmetic
On the issue of fines as a deterrent, people will be asking where the fines for meat processing plants were
Where were the fines for nursing homes given that 56% of people who have died in this pandemic were residents in nursing homes? Where are the fines for places like those? None of that has been included in this Bill
In meat processing plants with no social distancing, workers' rights were under threat in respect of getting sick pay and so forth
All that has been thrown in the air with this legislation
As I have said, it is largely cosmetic
There needs to be collective responsibility
The vast majority of people have adhered to the guidelines
The Bill is dangerous and will drive a wedge in the solidarity and the sense that we are in this together
People will now say that we are not all in this together
This is Government policy
We cannot go for a third or fourth lockdown because the Government will lose people; it will lose the dressing room at that stage
This will be completely academic and cosmetic in getting this under control
Policy is the most important thing
The country has six weeks to change its policy regarding what it is doing at the moment
We cannot go to another stage where we go back to a sense of normality at the start of December and then go back into another lockdown at the end of February
We cannot do that; it will break people
It is imperative now to have a policy change
Testing and tracing are extremely important
Opening the economy was a major mistake in the early summer
We should have crushed the virus with a zero-Covid policy to really get on top of the pandemic
If we do not, we will be in serious trouble
As I said, this is largely cosmetic
If one takes away all of the headlines over the past number of days, because an immense amount of money has been thrown at the economy due to Covid-19, one sector that this pandemic has had a disproportionate effect on are services such as physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech and language therapy and psychology
Of these services, most people were waiting for 12 months or more prior to the pandemic and it has exacerbated the whole situation
Even before Covid-19 we had many debates in this House about people with disabilities who faced great challenges around poverty, discrimination and low unemployment levels
Historically, the State has always underfunded disability services
The evidence of that is that over the past number of weeks St
John of God, a voluntary organisation that I used to work for, will cease its disability services activities in the next 12 months
That is very worrying for that sector
To put this in context, the €150 increase in the respite grant will equate to €2
80 per week
That is a very small amount for a person dependent on that
The €100 million announced for the disability-related Covid-19 costs is welcome without doubt, but this will only keep existing services, which are under serious pressure, up and running
Another factor in all the grimness of Covid-19 is to do with fundraising for voluntary bodies, which is down at least by 80%
That is having a detrimental effect on revenue for disability services
This will be the second year running where there has not been an increase in the disability allowance
All of that points to funding and resources for the disability sector
Many people, who do an incredible job, rely on those services
Service users and their families who have that outlet that is disability services have been under huge pressure, particularly in the past six months, and the stress and anxiety that brings is incalculable
I am not trying to underplay that but there is a great deal of anxiety about the next six months and where all of this will go, especially for families with challenging needs both in respect of the service and in the home environment
We need to ensure that the people who rely on services such as these are funded, whether it is the voluntary or non-voluntary sector
That should be done with a view to providing more resources to disability services in the coming six months and over the next five years
That is very important for everybody who uses the services in the State
I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time
" I wish to share my time with Deputies Barry and Boyd Barrett
I am thankful for the opportunity to have this debate
It is an important debate not only in this Chamber but also in the State itself
I wish to remember Marie Fleming, whose life ended seeking legislative change in regard to assisted dying in Ireland
Marie's incredible bravery and the fight she brought to the highest court in the land brought national attention to the most profound decision anybody could make
Her decision was to leave on her own terms, not in pain, not alone, but in dignity and surrounded by the ones she loved
Her life lives on
Her memory lives on
If she were here at this moment, she would be willing us all on to do the right thing
I thank Tom Curran, Marie Fleming's partner, Gail O'Rourke and Vicky Phelan for their input over the past five weeks
I want to thank Vicky especially for her support and for speaking candidly about the issue over recent weeks
Whatever the outcome next Wednesday, this issue can no longer be shunned away
The Bill has 15 Parts
The Bill would change the law in Ireland and help terminally ill people to control their own death when they decide their suffering is no longer bearable
At present, it is illegal for doctors and medical professionals to help terminally ill people in unbearable pain to end their own lives
This Bill would change that
Some people suffering from a terminal illness that will inevitably result in death face losing control over their lives and may have conditions that no longer respond to palliative care
The Bill would allow a person, who must be over 18 and suffering from a terminal illness, to make a declaration to two independent medical professionals requesting assistance to end his or her life
A third individual, an independent witness, must be present
The person seeking assistance must be diagnosed as having an incurable and progressive illness that cannot be reversed by treatment
The medical professionals must be sure the person has the capacity to make a rational choice and is fully aware of the alternatives, such as palliative care
Fourteen days after the process, the medical practitioner can administer substances to the person to assist in his or her passing
This Bill has safeguards and protections to ensure the person seeking help can make a decision independently and not under duress of any kind
This Bill does not allow for assisted dying in cases where a person looking for help does not suffer from a terminal illness
People suffering from depression or any mental health issues could not access this law
People suffering from life-threatening physical illnesses could not avail of assisted dying
People of advanced age could not avail of this law
It applies only to those suffering from a terminal illness and only to adults with full mental capacity and who are able to make a rational and conversant decision about their lives
Opponents of assisted dying say it would lead to a slippery slope, whereby the value of human life would be diminished
They fear vulnerable groups, such as the elderly and disabled, will be pressurised into assisted dying because they feel they are a burden on society
In fact, in the countries and regions where laws have been changed to help people, there is no evidence that this has ever happened
Oregon, for example, has had a similar law since 1997 and none of these trends has been observed
Other regions and countries have had the same experience, namely, Colorado, California, Washington, Montana, Vermont, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Belgium, Canada, Luxemburg and certain states in Australia
We want better supports and care for our elderly and those with disabilities
We want greater resources for hospice care and palliative care but there is no contradiction in supporting these and the right of people coming to the end of their lives who are suffering from unbearable pain
Some opponents of this legislation have used completely inappropriate language to conflate suicide and voluntary assisted dying
It is wholly inappropriate and irresponsible to use this kind of language
I ask Deputies to reflect on their positions and desist from using such language
I understand that the Government is tabling an amendment to this Bill
As I stated a number of days ago, this will unduly delay the Bill's progression to pre-legislative scrutiny
I do not understand why it has to go to an all-party committee because it has been discussed at length, even by an all-party Oireachtas committee on equality and justice two and a half years ago
I do not see why the Bill has to go down the route the Government would have it go down
I do not doubt the sincerity of the Minister and other Deputies in the Government benches but I doubt the rationale for unduly delaying the Bill with the amendment
This debate is extremely difficult for everybody, regardless of their views
All voices and opinions should be taken into account but the most important voice in the debate is that of a person with a terminal illness who does not want to go through unbearable pain
He or she should have a choice
This Bill is about giving a choice to people facing unbearable pain
We should support them and not vilify them
Let me refer to a lady called Gaynor French, who passed away a number of years ago
I will always remember an article of hers in the
I am happy to give four minutes to one of the other Deputies
Deputy Bríd Smith will take three and I will take two
It can be shared wherever-----
I thank all the contributors to the debate, and I was happy to give Deputy Fitzpatrick some time, even though I diametrically oppose what he said, but everybody should have their views heard
It is a shame there was not more time for the debate because I would like to have heard other people's views, even though I completely disagree with them, but that is what the debate is about
This is quite a complex debate
It is a very profound debate about mortality, our lives, futures and friends and the people we love
These are very difficult circumstances
For 16 years of my life, I have been a carer
I have cared for people in very difficult circumstances coming to the end of their lives
This is not about ending life
This is about living
People are in situations in which they do not want to die by any means
They want to live
I take exception to conflating this with suicide
People with a terminal illness are not suicidal
They want to live every second, minute and hour of every day and week to see their family and enjoy life
Sometimes, however, life is extremely cruel and a terminal illness chooses a person
No one chooses it
This will be an ongoing debate and these are the issues that will be teased out over time
I am not against having an all-party committee
My concern is that we have had reports and committees before but nothing ever happened
That has been my experience here
It is extremely frustrating when nothing happens
I hope this time it might be different
What is important in this debate is that politics is left outside
I know it is difficult sometimes but if we can leave our political allegiances outside, I think we can progress on this debate
This is about humanity, compassion and empathy for our fellow human beings who find themselves in the most difficult circumstances
They do not want to go through unbearable pain for themselves or for their families
On that basis, will the Minister of State drop the amendment to allow the Bill to proceed to pre-legislative scrutiny? This has been an honest but hard debate
While there are only a number of us here, many people outside are listening to this debate
They want us to step up to the plate and do the right thing
Next Thursday, a very important debate will take place in this House when the Dying with Dignity Bill 2020 is discussed
I understand there is a variety of views not only in political parties and this House but society as a whole on the subject
I call on the Minister to support a vote of conscience, not only in his party but across the Government parties
It is very important for society as a whole that there be a rational debate on the matter
I thank the Minister of State for taking this important issue
I raise the issue of the Moria refugee camp on the island of Lesbos in Greece
As the Minister of State is aware, a fire two weeks ago destroyed the camp and people were left destitute
All their belongings were destroyed and thousands of people are now without any kind of shelter on the island
This is a humanitarian crisis that has been festering for many years and has not been addressed by the Greek Government or the EU
The situation is now also set against the spectre of Covid-19
An outbreak has happened and 35 people in the camp have tested positive
This is an ongoing situation and the conditions are beyond inhumane
An Irish doctor, Dr
Claire Dunne, works on the island for Médecins sans Frontières, MSF
She paints a particularly dark and stark picture of life in the camp, and she wrote an article in the Nearly 12,000 refugees are living in the camp and they have all fled from the types of situations to which I referred
Some 4,000 of the refugees are children and 400 of those are unaccompanied children
As the site was originally built for 3,000 people, it now has four times the number of people it was designed to cater for
I seek a comment from the Minister of State regarding what Ireland intends to do in response to this situation
Germany stated last week that it will take 1,500 migrants from the camp, which is welcome
I know the Minister with responsibility for equality and integration, Deputy O'Gorman, stated that four unaccompanied minors will come to the State in the weeks to come
While this is welcome, I make the point that representatives of MSF have stated that Ireland and other EU member states have simply not done anything like enough regarding this issue
It has been left to fester for a long time but, thankfully, no one was killed in the fire
Thousands of people, however, have been left destitute
What will Ireland's response be in the weeks and months to come to take in some of the children and adults from this camp?
The EU's response to refugees fleeing from persecution in the past decade, particularly in recent years, has been shameful
It has allowed people to drown in the Mediterranean
That is a fact
It has also allowed this camp on Lesbos to fester
Pictures on BBC and RTÉ television of people living in the camp show them living in conditions worse than those for animals and the EU has let that happen
I refer the Minister of State to the EU's commitment
Ireland has stated that it will only undertake to accept 36 children from this camp but only eight children have been accepted thus far
Why is progress so slow? I refer back to Dr
Claire Dunne's analysis of the camp
She stated that EU member states should show solidarity and give people sanctuary, which is what they are asking for, and not to be treated like animals
Ireland should respond better than it has done and should take more of these unaccompanied children
I cannot comprehend what it is like to be in such a situation without parents
We should hold out our hands, accept more children from this situation and give people hope and a home
I thank the Minister of State for taking this important issue

We should hold out our hands, accept more children from this situation and give people hope and a home
I want to raise an issue that I have raised numerous times in the term of this Dáil and the last Dáil
It is the lack of progress around the medical cannabis access programme
I see the former Minister for Health in the Chamber
To say parents and patients are extremely frustrated is an understatement
The law was changed last year and many people had hope
Since then, there have been numerous issues with lack of reimbursement and lack of access
When will the medical cannabis access programme commence?
Deputy Harris is across the Chamber
People Before Profit will support this Bill
I want to cut to the chase
There have been many debates on renters and housing in this Chamber
Renters are being ripped off in the State
A small cohort of landlords are doing extremely well out of this
They are doing so well that they have commodified the basic human right to shelter
Does the Minister know how that has happened? It has happened because his Government and previous Governments have facilitated it
Getting to the juicy details, billions of euro have been transferred to private landlords through housing subsidy payments
This year more than €1 billion will go to private landlords because of the absence of public housing
Vulture funds were allowed to buy up billions of euro worth of loans and NAMA sold off property portfolios at vastly reduced prices
The vulture fund, Lone Star, paid €500 in corporate tax in 2016 while in the same year it made €15 million in profits
Has the world gone mad? The bad policy was created by previous Governments
The single biggest cause of homelessness is evictions from the private rental sector
Due to the lack of supply, rents have been inflated by the private sector
We have a generation that has witnessed the worst housing crisis in decades, not only in the rental market but in terms of the homelessness situation
Prior to the Covid-19 public health emergency, affordable houses were unaffordable and rents were almost unaffordable
In the past three months, rents in this State have risen by 0
It is obvious that rent increases are Covid-resistant
In Dublin Mid-West, landlords do not accept HAP but they accept homeless HAP which is 20% more than the market rate
For example, the rent for some houses is probably double what it was perhaps two years ago
Landlords are causing the crazy inflationary situation where people are being completely priced out of the market
This has been created by the neo-liberal policies of the Minister’s Government
That will only be challenged and overturned when that policy is overturned
There are still almost 9,500 people in emergency accommodation in this State
It is an absolute shame that this is happening
Until that is challenged, we will continue to come back to this Chamber to raise the same situation
In the upcoming Brexit legislation, how will the Government deal with the Dublin regulation, formally known as the Dublin III Regulation? The reason I ask is that a gentleman, Lehlohonolo Kalele, who is a citizen of Soweto and who is at present studying occupational safety and health in UCD will be deported, as of Saturday, back to Britain
There are other individuals in the same position
If he is deported via Britain, he will be deported back to Soweto
Obviously, this causes a conundrum for the Government in relation to the Brexit legislation, particularly around the Dublin III Regulation
Obviously, Mr
Kalele wants to stay in this country
He wants to contribute, like many people who seek asylum here
How will the Taoiseach tackle that conundrum?
I move:That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to make provision for assistance in achieving a dignified and peaceful end of life to qualifying persons and related matters
I am introducing the Dying with Dignity Bill 2020 on behalf of Solidarity-People Before Profit
I do not do this in jubilation but with determination that this very personal issue is discussed openly and rationally
If enacted, this Bill will make legal and medical provision for achieving a peaceful end to life for those with a progressive and incurable terminal illness
Compassion, empathy and humanity should be at the heart of this debate
From the outset, the most important voice in the debate is that of the individual who has been diagnosed with a terminal illness
That individual should have a choice to make a fully conversant decision on how his or her condition progresses and concludes
The debate should not be framed as an alternative to palliative and hospice care in any way
This can be a very difficult conversation for a society
Whatever one's views on voluntary assisted dying, all views should be respected and listened to with mutual and collective respect
This Bill would not have been possible were it not for the incredible bravery of the late Marie Fleming
I never met Marie, but I know that if she were sitting in the Visitors Gallery now, she would be willing us on
Before Marie passed away in 2013, the Supreme Court stated in its ruling that there was no impediment in this Parliament to legislating for voluntary assisted dying
I also wish to mention Tom Curran, Marie Fleming's partner
Without Tom's guidance and input to this Bill, it would not have been possible
I also thank the former Independent Deputy, John Halligan, who introduced this Bill in 2015
I appeal to the public and fellow Deputies to give thought and reflection to this Bill over the coming weeks
If there is not a clear party or Government position to let this Bill progress, I ask the Taoiseach and party leaders to allow a free vote or vote of conscience on this issue
In the most profoundly difficult circumstances people should have a choice to have a dignified and peaceful end to their lives on their own terms when the pain and suffering become unbearable
Assisted dying is not about ending life but about ending suffering when a person no longer has the option of living
They have not made that decision
It has been taken out of their hands
I move: "That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time
I wish the Minister of State well and hope he will be progressive and bold in his job in the next years
The Government needs to be bold because this is like Groundhog Day
We are talking about things we talked about two or three years ago in this Chamber
People have been talking about this issue for decades
It is welcome that we are talking about a health-led approach rather than a criminal justice approach, which simply does not work
Last year's alternative approaches to possession of drugs for personal use were welcome but they did not go far enough
I understand the sentiment of that report will be sent to the Citizens' Assembly
I have a problem with this because we are legislators
Last February, 160 of us were elected by the people of Ireland to legislate
The Citizens' Assembly does good work but we are here to make laws
The current system simply does not work
Bringing people through the courts for possession of small amounts drugs is a waste of time
Bringing somebody through the criminal justice system for €50 or €100 worth of cannabis is a waste of police time, the State's time and everybody’s time
There needs to be a health-led approach
The benchmark is Portugal
In 2001, it embarked on the decriminalisation road
It is a difficult road to go down
Drug use and abuse is difficult, as I have seen in my own community
Drugs can take over a community and they take over people's lives
It is extremely difficult to deal with in the community and on a personal level
That is compounded by the class nature of society and by austerity and cutbacks to youth services
International evidence and research shows that if there is investment in people and in communities there will be less people turning to drugs
Why would people turn to heroin in the first place? It is the most horrible drug in the world
However, people are desperate sometimes
In situations of alienation, they turn to that because of the class nature of society
That is not abstract
Across the world, heroin gets into communities
Heroin is the devil that attracts poor and marginalised communities
That is where it manifests itself
There is an alternative economy in society
It is hugely lucrative and violent
In the last ten to 15 years, the violence attributed to drug use and the drug market is ever more violent because it is so lucrative that it is impossible to put down, even if there were 20,000 gardaí on the street
Once people want a substance, they will get it
Once there is a market for it and a demand, people will use it
We have to be grown up about this conversation
People will use and abuse drugs
Those people are from every part of society
Our heads are in the sand if we keep bringing people through the criminal justice system and locking them up
It is simply a waste of time
We have to be bold and take a different approach to addiction and to why people turn to addiction
If I am still around in ten or 15 years' time, we will still be talking about this issue of the cruelty of bringing people who suffer from addiction through the criminal justice system
We have to adopt a new approach which is nuanced
There has to be an approach of legalising certain drugs and decriminalising the person as opposed to the drugs themselves, which will be a different argument
As I said, international evidence across the board shows that when there is a health-led approach, there are better outcomes because this issue comes down to saving lives
If lives can be saved by taking people out of the criminal justice system, then we will be on the right road
It will not be easy by any means
It is extremely difficult in circumstances of drug addiction and abuse
The approach from the previous Governments has been a failure
We should be honest about that
What is happening is like Groundhog Day, so we have to adopt a different approach
That approach should be similar to some of those I have just outlined
I wish the Minister of State well in her new job
As a result of Covid, the past six months have affected the well-being of everybody but old people have suffered disproportionately
A total of 56% of all deaths have been in nursing homes and the vast majority of deaths in the State have been of older people
There was, and still is, a sense of fear with regard to how old people interact
Even the word "cocooning" was almost derogatory and some older people took its use to task
In all of the grimness there was a bit of light because sometimes in the darkness there has to be sunshine
There was an amazing film in the "Letters from Lockdown" short film series by RTÉ about Margaret Lynch who is 100 years old
It is absolutely fantastic and really encompasses the generational gap between older people and their grandchildren and how Covid affects them and their families
Every time I see the film I shed a tear - but I also smile - because of the effect the past six months have had on old people
There has been a digital divide in the past six months, which has been compounded by the ageist society we have
There are many things the Minister of State cannot do but something practical she could do is what Age Action is calling for, which is to include in the budget for 2021 a digital allowance in the form of a €2
50 increase in the telephone support allowance because of the digital divide during the lockdown
This would be very welcome
I noted the contribution of the Minister of State on day care centres and Deputy Ellis made a pertinent point on these services
My mother goes to a service in Clondalkin but she has not been there for the past six months
She was going every day to get her hair done, have her dinner and meet her friends but this has broken down
It is very important that these services resume very quickly
The lack of routine and social isolation that have happened are unquantifiable with regard to older people in the State
If there is one thing the Minister of State can do in practical terms it is to try to address the aftershock of Covid, what we are living with and what it has done to old people
This can be done through opening up day centres as soon as possible, when all of the guidelines have been adhered to, and giving more resources to the older generation in particular
They have paid their taxes and done everything but the pandemic has stopped them in their tracks
There is always hope and I have referred to the "Letters from Lockdown" short films
There is always hope
There is hope in adversity and there is hope in this pandemic
I doubt the Minister of State will disagree that the past six months have been extremely detrimental for children with special needs and their level of access to the services they need
The effects on children and their families are probably unquantifiable
Those effects are ongoing
The lack of routine and structure has been detrimental
The cessation of services and difficulty in accessing ongoing services have caused regression in learning and peer-to-peer relationships
In many cases, certain challenging behaviours have arisen at home where it is not visible to the outside world and that has caused difficulties in the family environment
Familiarity is very important in the context of special education
My question for the Minister of State relates to parents who are listening to her and other members of the Government this evening
Prior to Covid, the system of special education and assessment of needs was quite dysfunctional
I will not go over those issues again
Parents will want to know what resources and support the Department will give to parents and schools that provide these services which were slightly dysfunctional even before Covid
What support will the Government provide to them in the coming six months to a year?
I asked the Minister of State a question
I am sharing time with Deputy Paul Murphy
I congratulate the Leas-Cheann Comhairle on her surprise win yesterday
We were all delighted
Well, it was a surprise for a few of us
I am sure the Minister was seriously alarmed by the HIQA report published on Tuesday
It gave a terrible insight into the challenges and the failures of nursing homes during the public health emergency
I understand from the media that the Covid committee will recommend a review of all deaths in nursing homes
I read the report this morning
It is damning
In fact, it is beyond damning
One statistic, which I will not cite because it is quite a long section, is that 60% of the nursing homes that were assessed had weak governance and management during the public health emergency
The alarm bells are going off, not only for Deputies but also for the residents of those nursing homes and their loved ones
There must be an urgent review
I hope that the Minister will support this call
I spoke a number of weeks ago about the St
Mary's Centre nursing home, also called the Telford Centre, on Merrion Road
I sent the Minister correspondence on this issue two weeks ago
It is run by the Sisters of Charity and some of its residents have been there for more than 20 years
At the end of the year, however, the facility is due to close down
That is a terrible shame
The staff are upset by the potential closure and its 35 residents are worried about the situation
Will the Minister comment on its potential closure and give a commitment that the facility will be taken over by the State and run by the HSE? It is a great facility that has existed for more than 150 years, but if it closes down, it will be closed for good
In view of the HIQA report, there has been a juxtaposition during the Covid emergency between the 80% of nursing homes that are run by for-profit companies and facilities such as St
Mary's, which will close down if the State does not intervene
The Minister needs to intervene and St
Mary's should be taken over by the HSE
I commend the Debenhams workers who have been on strike for more than 105 days through very difficult circumstances because of the public health emergency
Anybody who has visited the picket line would be inspired and amazed by their determination over 14 or 15 weeks
It has been a very difficult time but their solidarity and support for each other is inspiring for anybody who supports the trade union movement
It is everything that is good about working class people
It is about standing together, shoulder to shoulder, when they are up against it
These workers are fighting for a fair redundancy
Some of these people have worked with Debenhams for over 25 years
Can the Minister of State imagine how he would feel if he was treated like that having worked for an employer for 25 years? He would feel very aggrieved
That is the reason the workers have been on the picket line since April
They will win
The Dáil is almost like a bubble
It passes legislation to protect workers and so forth but in one night in 2008, the banks were completely guaranteed in respect of all their debts, yet legislation that could protect workers in redundancy such as the Debenhams workers has never been passed
That leaves a very bitter taste in people's mouths
It is ironic that the Bank of Ireland has a 14% share in Debenhams so it has an obligation to the workers to give them a decent settlement and a decent redundancy
As a member of the Government, the Minister of State should call in members of Bank of Ireland and ask them what their obligation is to the Debenhams workers
He has the power to do that because in 2008 the Government bailed out the banks to the tune of €4
6 billion
I will repeat that figure - €4
6 billion
It is an incredible amount of money
Taxpayers in this country have been on the line for that money yet workers are screwed every time they try to stand up to their employers
The Debenhams workers are an inspiration, not only to the trade union movement but to the working-class movement
It is up to us to pass this motion today to send a message to those workers that they can and will win
I welcome the motion
I commend Deputy Funchion on her consistency on this issue
It is a very good, structured motion
I welcome some elements of the Minister's statement, especially with regard to meeting representatives of SIPTU, and good luck with that
I put it to the Minister that it is not an exaggeration to say that the provision of childcare is extremely fragmented in Ireland, if not almost archaic
There are very high costs and the workforce of educators is underpaid and undervalued
According to the latest SIPTU survey of workers in the childcare sector, they are going under and leaving the sector
The SIPTU Covid-19 Back to Work survey shows that since the end of June some 29% of the workers indicated they are earning less than before the pandemic, with 32% of the workers intending to leave the sector in the next 12 months, which is very alarming
Most early years professionals earn below the living wage of €12
40 per hour
This has resulted in a turnover of more than 40% of workers leaving full day care services
Only five months ago there was a huge demonstration of childcare workers
It seems like years ago but it happened five months ago, with at least 15,000 to 20,000 people attending that demonstration
It was one of the best demonstrations I had been on in a long time
Those workers were demanding a couple of simple things, including, obviously, pay and conditions
The early years educational sector is not working for those workers, it is not working for parents and it is not working for children
We cannot be unambiguous about this
We need a State-led childcare system
It is a fact that in other countries such as the Scandinavian countries the best outcomes are state led
There is a very good article in today's edition of
I am sharing time with Deputy Boyd Barrett
I wish the new Minister well
We will get the niceties out of the way and then we will get political
I think we all agree that by comparison with March, the Irish classroom will look very different in September
The last five months have shown us the major fault lines in our public services in health, education etc
I refer to the statistic that Ireland has one of the highest pupil-teacher ratios in the OECD
In some cases, one in five children is in a class of 30 or more pupils
If that is the case, it will be a gigantic challenge if schools are to look in any way like they were in March
This issue comes down to resources and I have three questions on that issue
In the area of education, the Government should examine what was done with the Be On Call for Ireland initiative in the health sector
The former Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, is here
I refer to a call for people in education systems abroad to come back to Ireland and lend us their expertise, because this will be a call to arms in September to get our classrooms ready and have the education system that we had in March
I have three questions that I hope the Minister will be able to address
Will the Department look into recruiting final year students in teacher training courses to work in primary and secondary schools in September? I know this was done with student nurses
Is the Department looking for alternative spaces, particularly around schools, in areas where there are going to be major problems concerning space in classrooms? Is the Department looking for extra space on campuses or near campuses? Will the Department call for a freeze on proposed reductions in teacher numbers in certain schools come September? I ask that because some schools will lose teachers because they might have a slightly different number of pupils than they did last September
It does not make sense for schools to lose teachers, so will the Department put a freeze on that happening? I will be very happy if the Minister can answer those three questions
The Taoiseach spoke about the issue of access to medicinal cannabis numerous times in the last Dáil, to his credit
It is three and a half years since the Health Products Regulatory Authority recommended that a medical cannabis programme be set up
Last year, the law was changed in this country
For the first time, medical practitioners could legally prescribe medical cannabis
Since then, not one person has been prescribed medical cannabis unless they go through the licensing system
As the Taoiseach knows, this system is extremely bureaucratic and those people have to go to Holland and so forth
Can the Taoiseach give a commitment that this programme, which is in the programme for Government, will be commenced as soon as possible?
The last two Ministers for Health, Deputies Harris and Stephen Donnelly, said they would come back to me and they have not
At the same time, people are going without, including vulnerable children
It is a terrible injustice
I will get the niceties out of the way first by wishing the Minister well in his role
I expressed the same wish to his predecessor, Deputy Harris, four years ago
Once that is done, we can go ahead with not being nice to each other
I want to raise a number of issues, the first of which is the effect of Covid-19 on the nursing homes sector
I welcome the additional provision in the Revised Estimates to deal with the crisis
However, the level of death in nursing homes during the Covid pandemic is a national scandal
There is a lot of speculation as to why it happened
That question probably cannot be answered here and will have to be dealt with in a different venue
The relatives of those who passed away will want to know why their loved ones passed away in such a manner
Over the past 20 years, we have, in effect, privatised care of the elderly
The statistic that stands out is that 20 years ago, 80% of nursing homes were public and 20% were private
Today, the opposite is the case
I am not being ideological in raising this issue
Many studies have shown that where there is privatisation of healthcare - we have seen it during the Covid crisis - the outcomes are much poorer than is the case when there is public provision of healthcare services
That has to be taken on board
The Minister's predecessor said that we need a new process and a change of direction in dealing with the question of private versus public provision
I draw the Minister's attention to St
Mary's nursing home, also called the Telford Centre, which is located off the Merrion Road, not too far from here, and is due to close down at the end of the year
This facility has been completely free of Covid infection and the staff are devastated that it is to be closed down
Will the Minister examine how this nursing home might be brought into public ownership? We need to give the residents and staff hope that it will remain open into the future
My last question concerns an issue I have raised
There are times when one has to make a stand, not because it is popular or unpopular but because it is the right thing to do
The omission of the occupied territories Bill from the programme for Government was the time to make that stand
The people of Palestine are tired of platitudes from the EU and the international community
My appeal is that the occupied territories Bill be passed and legislated for by this Government
The time for platitudes is over
The time for showing solidarity to the Palestinian people is now
We have let down the Palestinian people because of the omission of this occupied territories Bill
It is time to pass this legislation
I am sharing time with Deputy Barry
I raised the issue of Palestine with the Minister last week
Israel has vowed to annex the Jordan Valley, which makes up 30% of the occupied West Bank, this time next week
The EU has specifically stated that if Israel makes this move, it will be contrary to international law and decency
If this action takes place, what will the European Union do to penalise the state of Israel? As Deputy Cian O'Callaghan has said, this is against the background of the occupied territories Bill being omitted from the programme for Government
It is no coincidence that the Israeli ambassador as well as US Congressmen and Congresswomen had been lobbying the three parties on the programme for Government
We can see what is at play
With all this in the background, in respect of the EU and Israel and the economic trade between them, what penalties is the EU going to impose on the state of Israel for its aggression and its proposed annexation of the West Bank?
The Minister has accepted that we need changes in our public health service and the Covid-19 public health emergency has shown the cracks in our system, such as bed capacity and staffing shortages
The running down of our public health service over the past number of decades has been hugely detrimental to all citizens in this country
The new programme for Government states that it will examine new ways to utilise community settings and create partnerships with our private hospitals to avoid placing increased pressure on our public health services, a statement I found deeply depressing
That is going backwards rather than forwards
There is no recognition of the thousands of beds that were taken out of our health service or staff shortages
Will it be the old way, the new way or another way?
On countless occasions over the past four years I have raised the issue of the medical cannabis access programme
This time last year the Minister announced that the programme would be functional
That was underpinned for, I understand, the first time in medical history by a statutory instrument which allowed people to access medical cannabis legally
The Minister said he expected people to be prescribed medical cannabis by the autumn
Does he know how many people have been prescribed medical cannabis under the programme? The answer is not one person
Not a week goes by without parents of very vulnerable children ringing me to ask how they can get access to medical cannabis because their children are in desperate situations
I have run out of things to say to these parents
I can only say so much
They return to their doctors who tell them they do not know anything about the programme
Access has been four years in the making
It is referenced in the programme for Government, which is welcome, but the Minister has to give a commitment to parents and patients on getting access to medical cannabis under the programme
Can he give a commitment on this in his last couple of weeks as Minister for Health?
I will not raise Brexit but the issue of illegal trade
Last week, I raised with the Tánaiste the Control of Economic Activities (Occupied Territories) Bill, which seeks to ban the importation of illegal goods from settlements in the occupied West Bank
His answer was very glib
He said he would not do so
He obviously has form on this
For the record, I think all Israeli goods should be banned from this country
He stated that the Attorney General's advice is that it is not compatible with EU law
That is very refutable
He has never made the advice public even though the vast majority of Deputies passed the occupied territories legislation to go to the next Stage
It is in the interest of-----
It relates to trade
There is
I suggest that there is
In 1986, the Attorney General of this country gave a recommendation that the ban on the importation of South African apartheid fruit and goods was illegal
A year later Ireland was the first country to ban all apartheid goods from South Africa
The Minister of State can put the legislation in question into the programme for Government
The Government can also publish the Attorney General's advice on this
That is in the interest not only of the people of Ireland but also of the people of Palestine
That is a terrible response
The Minister of State is a member of the Government that has refused this legislation, which has been passed in the Seanad and the Dáil
She has an obligation to give me an answer to explain why this legislation is not going into the programme for Government
Fianna Fáil and the Green Party agreed the legislation
The world is watching this country
Can we imagine if this country passed the legislation in question? It would give inspiration to all the people of Palestine and to the world against oppression and brutality
This country can do it as it did in 1986
Why can we not do it now? What is the difference?
Will the Government publish the Attorney General's advice? Why can-----
Can the Minister of State overrule it?
Will it be in the programme for Government?
I have two questions for the Minister
My first question is on the July provision
He has stated numerous times that the provision depends on teachers and SNAs making themselves available for a period
What is the uptake? I was contacted by a parent from Lucan who is in a very difficult situation
Her school cannot accommodate the July provision due to remedial works taking place and no SNAs or teachers have made themselves available
I am sure everybody will understand what has happened over the last 13 or 14 weeks
Children with special needs have been in their home environments and their routines and structures have been completely lost
This is causing incalculable stress not only for the children but also for their parents
The Minister has stated that 70% of the July provision is home based but parents and children need to get out of the home
If a school is closed or cannot make accommodation available, where else can the July programme be provided to parents such as those I mentioned?
My next question is on the pupil-teacher ratio
I am not being parochial but to give an example, in Scoil Íde Catholic primary school in Clondalkin the number of pupils has changed slightly since last September, which means it will lose a teacher next September
The Minister can understand that in September schools will be under serious pressure because of the ongoing public health emergency with regard to physical distancing
In this situation, some of the classes will have gone from the recommended 26 pupils per teacher to 35 pupils per teacher
This will not be possible in September
There needs to be more teachers and resources and not fewer in September
Will the Minister make a commitment that there will be no reduction in teachers in September, particularly given the situation over the past six months, which has been traumatic for teachers and pupils? There should be more resources and not fewer in September
I would like the Minister to explain a reply my party member Deputy Bríd Smith got on the proposed liquefied natural gas, LNG, terminal at the Port of Cork
With regard to climate action, this represents a quite substantial shift
Many in this Chamber believed that Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil were moving away from the concept of LNG terminals
Let me quote material from the talks going on not far from this place: "Both of our parties accept that as we move towards carbon neutrality, it does not make sense to build new large-scale fossil fuel infrastructure such as liquid natural gas import terminals [at this moment]
" According to the reply Deputy Bríd Smith received, the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, which I acknowledge is not the Department of Mr
Ross, and Gas Networks Ireland are supportive of the project
The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport should correct me if I am wrong in believing this represents a major policy shift by the Government
How can we take this Government or the next one seriously on the importation of fracked gas into Ireland? Could the Minister comment on that?
It is from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport
No, it relates to the proposed LNG site at the Port of Cork
It is very ambiguous
It essentially indicates that the memorandum of understanding from the Port of Cork states that it still wants to import the fracked LNG
Is the Government against this or is it the Government's policy to have such a facility not only in Shannon but also the Port of Cork? This is from the Minister's Department
The Minister and I have spoken about the issue of July provision and special needs education weekly
I do not know whether the Minister saw the report on the RTÉ news on Tuesday
It was heartbreaking to see those two families in that situation
It was terrible to see the stress and anxiety parents with children with complicated needs are going through
They have no outlet or routine
It is very difficult
Not having that routine is extremely difficult not only for the children but for the family as well
The sooner there is structure, the better
Can the Minister give structure and a definitive answer in respect of the July programme to those families? Will there be a July programme come July? Families in that situation simply cannot take any more
Will it begin at the end of June or the start or July?
I have another question about children in disadvantaged areas
Will there be provision for that cohort of students, especially over the summer period? As we said last week, many students have not been in school since 13 March
It is especially acute around disadvantage
Some students will simply drop out
Significant resources will have to be put towards those students
What are the Department plans in this area? I have read about online supports for July provision
What will that contain? Sometimes the outlet is the routine of going outside the family home
That is essential and it gives parents a break
What online provision is included in the July provision?
I have questions for the Minister
Before speaking about them I want to pay tribute to and remember Melanie Hill Rutherford, who sat in the Gallery three and a half years ago to observe the passing of legislation on medical cannabis
Unfortunately, she passed away two weeks ago
She was a great advocate for medical cannabis and used it for her pain
If she was still here, she would ask the Minister please to get on with the programme because people need it and are being denied it or have to go elsewhere
I want to send my condolences to her family at this terrible time
My first question concerns the 8,000 healthcare workers in this country who have contracted Covid-19
We have one of the highest rates in the world
Would the Minister support the INMO in its call for an inquiry into the level of infection among healthcare workers? As of 26 May, over 35% of the 8,000 workers affected were nurses
The rate of infection is quite high
Will the Minister call for an inquiry?
My second question is on the screening programme, particularly BreastCheck
I know the Minister spoke about this today
I have been contacted by a number of women in Dublin Mid-West about the length of time it takes to get an appointment which is not acceptable, either post-Covid or pre-Covid
There is no logic in women having to wait so long
We now need to look at the long term, the short term and so forth
Based on what Covid has done to society, we need to increase capacity regarding resources, nurses and access to public healthcare
The two-tier system is simply not sustainable
Even people who might have believed it before the pandemic are saying that public healthcare systems such as those in mainland Europe and in Britain are actually better for society
They are the fault lines the next Government should fix
Particularly with BreastCheck, of course there are issues with the 2 m distancing in confined spaces
Would the Minister call for more capacity for BreastCheck because many women are experiencing anxiety while awaiting an appointment?
I will be sharing my time with Deputy Paul Murphy
I and my party express sorrow over George Floyd's death and our solidarity with his family in the United States
Nobody had heard of George Floyd until a number of days ago
His name is now attached to brutality of racism in the United States
We also send our solidarity to the Black Lives Matter movement in the United States, which is confronting the poison of racism and the police brutality protesters are confronted with
Obviously, these protests are spreading across the world
Today we rightly condemned oppression and racism that go on across the world
When it comes to racism and oppression in another part of the world, namely, Israel, we have a different tone to it
We criticise it, but there are no consequences for Israeli racism
The Israeli Government has said that in July it will annex a part of land it has already robbed, namely the Jordan Valley
The consequence of this could be the spread of serious disruption and violence across the Middle East
The Tánaiste can do something as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, through the Control of Economic Activities (Occupied Territories) Bill
He can send a message to the world and the EU, and to Israel, the purveyor of oppression and racism, that we will make a stand against that
Will the Tánaiste make provision in respect of the Control of Economic Activity (Occupied Territories) Bill 2018 in the new programme for Government?
I am sharing time with Deputy Paul Murphy
There has been a clamour in certain sectors of society that the pandemic unemployment payment should be either immediately cut or tapered off
Much dog-whistling comes with this
The narrative is that people on the Covid payment are living it up
That is very selective by the people who say it
It is usually from the very top and is socially poisonous
That narrative was driven home during debates here on social housing many times
There was a narrative that social housing is somehow free, one does not pay any rent and so forth
I really object to that
There is now a narrative that there is free money regarding Covid
Nothing could be further from the truth
Most people working before this pandemic were paying PRSI and income tax
Ironically they will still pay PRSI and income tax by the end of the year if they get the payment
That type of narrative is socially poisonous
The facts are that more than one third of those on the Covid payment were earning less than €300 a week before they were laid off
Ireland has the third highest level of low pay in the OECD with 23% of full-time workers in low-paid work while the OECD average is 16%
That sizeable 23% are the working poor
They work very hard for a very bad wage
One thing that has been shown to us over the past three months is that working people who do not earn a significant income make a significant contribution to society
Workers in supermarkets and shops, those driving people to work, are on the front line of this pandemic
It shows how much of a contribution they make to society
Sometimes, however, they are pilloried in society
Will the Department continue the Covid payment for those workers who cannot go back to work until this public emergency finishes, either due to health reasons or safety at work issues?
The Taoiseach said that
He said it was free money
Does the Minister know what the Taoiseach was getting at?
They are
The Minister knows that as well as I do
It is socially priceless
It is true
I am sharing time with Deputy Paul Murphy
I have two questions for the Minister
The first concerns testing of front-line healthcare workers
Healthcare workers across the world have suffered a terrible toll in fighting this pandemic
In Britain, 200 NHS workers - doctors, nurses, care assistants and auxiliary staff - have died
It has been a terrible toll
In Ireland, more than a quarter of front-line workers have contracted the virus
That is 25% and that has also taken a huge toll
It takes three days for a front-line worker to be tested and for the result to come back
Does the Minister envisage a time when the period relating to testing front-line workers will be much shorter? It has to be under 24 hours
I offer the example of a nurse who does a shift, finishes work and is then tested for Covid-19
Does the Minister envisage that nurse having to work his or her next shift, which may be the next day, without having received a test result? It seems impossible that this could be allowed
My next question is not in respect of Covid
Last year, the Minister made an announcement regarding access to Spinraza for those living with spinal muscular atrophy
Unfortunately, the response I received yesterday to a parliamentary question indicates that fewer than half of the applicants approved for Spinraza have received it
Glen McHugh Farrelly, one of those applicants, is 19 years old and a student at Maynooth University
He is frustrated by the process
He thought he was going to get Spinraza at this time last year and would be able to move on with his life
However, 18 of the applicants have not received the drug
The Minister knows as well as I do that time is of the utmost essence in the context of this drug and the condition
Can he give any assurance to those 18 people and their families that they will be able to access this drug as soon as possible?
It is a long time since we needed the environment and nature so much
The darkness of the pandemic has drawn us to parks, canals and other amenities to which we would not normally be drawn, and that is a very good thing
There is a new appreciation for our surroundings, which is also a really good thing
Canals such as the Royal Canal and the Grand Canal are probably being more used than ever because they are good amenities, they are near people's houses and there are no cars in their immediate vicinity
Many people will holiday in Ireland this summer
The vast majority of people will not travel outside of the State
Will the Department consider making the cultural and heritage sites in the State available to families at concessionary rates or free of charge? These sites are quite expensive for families
Will the Department consider making sites owned by the State free of charge to families who present at them?
My second question is topical
In recent months, car access has been restricted in the Phoenix Park
I think the Phoenix Park is the second largest city park in the world
Central Park in New York is the biggest, although I might not be correct on that
Anyway, it is an amazing amenity in the city of Dublin
Will the Minister review the use of cars, especially around the side roads of the Phoenix Park? Obviously, the main thoroughfare should be available for car use
Will the Minister consider banning cars from certain roads in the Phoenix Park?
Many artists, singers, poets and so on have lost their livelihoods over a short period and the future for them is uncertain
Would the State support the idea of having gatherings in public spaces where physical distancing is adhered to? There could be performances by poets and singers and so on in spaces such as the Phoenix Park on a small scale that adhere to physical distancing as instructed by the authorities
The Minister referenced the July provision a number of times in the past hour and a half
This is obviously a vital service for students with an intellectual disability
Can he give us a bit more meat on the bones in relation to that provision? Could it be extended into August, if possible, because a lot of students have been out of school for a considerable amount of time and the service is vital for them at this time? I ask the Minister to respond before I move on to my second question
My second question concerns early school leavers in DEIS schools
This age group includes those aged between 13 and 16 and, like their peers, they have been out of school since March
That has taken a heavy toll on that age group and these students are at disproportionate risk of leaving school early
Has the Department made provision regarding class sizes and extra resources for those students in DEIS schools? My educational background was in DEIS schools in Neilstown, although I do not think it was the DEIS scheme back then
It was a completely different experience
I am probably showing my age, but it has been about 30 years since I did my leaving certificate and that was a completely different educational experience from what it is in Clondalkin now
When I was doing my leaving certificate, only a small number of people went on to third level education
Now, I think it is more than 35% of people in Collinstown
That is brilliant because education can set us free from the disadvantage of economics
However, are resources available for school leavers? I refer to these students in particular because they are at the age where they can fall through the cracks for all sorts of reasons
Can the Department provide extra resources for that age group in particular?
I am sharing time with Deputy Mick Barry
I have two questions
The vast majority of teachers and parents welcome the clarification on the leaving certificate
When the Minister spoke here two weeks ago, it was clear that it was not logistically possible to do the leaving certificate
The big issue for teachers is that they will now judge their own pupils for State exams
They want to be advocates for their students rather than stand in judgment
There is obviously unease about predictive grading in the teaching profession
There is also the dynamic regarding lobbying by students, which is quite unethical
The predictive grades model is discriminatory and will compound educational disadvantage in Ireland
Will the Minister consider having the State Examinations Commission and the Department of Education and Skills assess and do the grading rather than teachers?
My second question is about students with special educational needs in DEIS schools
They have more than likely been experiencing difficulties, especially engaging in remote learning in the past two months
Does the Department have plans to ameliorate the loss of teaching time for these students and to increase the number of special education teachers and SNAs in September or October of the next academic year?
I wish to share time with Deputy Mick Barry
Unfortunately, 2020 is shaping up to be an  My other question relates to when tourism begins to come back to some semblance of normality
To some degree, the date we are all looking at is 20 July which is when people can travel across the State
When workers are again employed in hotels, bars and suchlike, will they be given a guarantee on their health and safety in particular? Will an agency such as the HSE provide guidance and monitor workers who are in situations where they could be put at risk? At this stage, most people will take staycations, which is a good thing
Ireland is an incredible country that has everything to offer, although sometimes we are a bit unlucky when it comes to a lack of sunshine
That said, it is a beautiful country whether there is rain or sun
My two questions are about support for seasonal workers and guidance on health and safety for workers when they come back into the tourism and hospitality sector
Will the Minister of State provide guidance and a response in that regard?
I am sharing time with Deputy Paul Murphy
It seems like an eternity since, on 5 February, we saw the biggest national demonstration by childcare workers calling for a national investment in childcare
It seems like a different century almost, and it was three days before the general election
I was at it, like others in this Chamber, and it was an unprecedented demonstration
There must have been about 20,000 people at it
There was an incredible atmosphere
The main issues were in respect of low pay, retention of staff, high cost of crèche places, affordability and insurance costs
Those issues almost created a perfect storm around childcare
One of the main messages from that demonstration was the fragmented nature of childcare in Ireland
Generally the Minister has done a good job in her position but childcare is - I do not like using the word - slightly dysfunctional in Ireland
One thing that needs to come out of the post-pandemic world is that childcare for all workers, front-line and essential workers, should be free and should be funded from the point of central taxation
I welcome that places will be available for front-line workers
I think a figure of 5,000 was mentioned for the home setting
Why did it take so long for that to happen? Why did it take nine weeks to happen after all the schools were closed in the State? A large number of front-line workers were extremely frustrated about getting access to childcare
Before, sometimes they would give their children to grandparents and so forth, but that was not feasible whatsoever
This shows the dysfunctional aspects of childcare in Ireland
If there is one thing that needs to come out of the post-pandemic situation, it is that childcare needs to be looked at and made free at the point of availability
I am sharing time with Deputy Barry
My main question centres on the rescheduling of the leaving certificate
As we all understand, that decision will be taken in early June, which is five weeks away
There is a huge amount of uncertainty and a lack of clarity on this issue and there is a huge amount of anxiety among all parties, including teachers, parents and students
The general trend across Europe is quite mixed
In Britain, they have completely cancelled all exams this year
In France, they have cancelled all exams and they have done the same in the Netherlands
Some countries are waiting on the best medical advice
Those approaches should be kept in consideration over the next while
People Before Profit's view is that the leaving certificate should be cancelled and students should be admitted to a college certification scheme where grades would be allocated based on their work throughout the year
Any student that is not satisfied with his or her results should be allowed to sit the exam
The current situation is disadvantageous to students from underprivileged backgrounds because of a lack of access to laptops, Wi-Fi and educational space because most students are at home
That is a key factor
If the situation on 1 June is the same in relation to the recommendations on public health and gatherings of any size, is it the Minister's intention to cancel the leaving certificate and to give clarity on this issue?
It is nice to see you again, a Cheann Comhairle
I am sure there has been a sense of the surreal among people for the past four weeks
That also applies to the proceedings today and with regard to what is happening to people's well-being and health
In a matter of weeks, hundreds of thousands of people have lost their jobs, incomes and livelihoods
The sense of insecurity we are experiencing has not been seen for generations
Today's figures make for sombre reading
Some 500,000 people are now on the live register, an increase of 13% since 1 January
That figure is incredible and I do not think anybody could have predicted the number of job losses in that period
Even more sombre are figures from the United States today where some 6
6 million people have filed for unemployment benefits in the past week
We are entering the vortex of an economic depression that the world has never seen
That is not being alarmist
It is probably what we are facing
A vast number of people will be affected by this pandemic
Job losses will be temporary for most
We must be upfront with people
Some people will lose their jobs permanently
Many people are accessing social welfare for the first time in their working lives
As I indicated, hundreds of thousands of people accessed social welfare over the past couple of weeks, specifically those taking the Covid-19 payment, and we must commend the workers who processed all those claims in the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection
They have done a fantastic job in an unprecedented and unbelievable environment
I have a series of questions, although they may not come under the remit of the Minister in the Chamber
Will the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection consider a universal payment of €350 for all workers who have lost income in the past number of weeks? There are many anomalies with the Covid-19 payment, including those affecting people who are over 66, people working in the gig economy and students on work study visas who had not started before the relevant date
They do not get the €350 payment because they are out of the bracket
Is there a provision in the Department for a solidarity payment, perhaps, for people on disability or illness benefit in this period? Is there a special provision of rent allowance for people who are unable to meet their rent? Is there any provision for reward payments for front-line workers in the public health system? My final points relate to the wage subsidy scheme and an anomaly therein
Anybody earning over €586 per week should get €410 in the wage subsidy scheme
They are currently only getting €350 and are therefore losing out with this anomaly
The information I have indicates this could be changed through a ministerial order
Would the Department consider it appropriate to change this anomaly in the wage subsidy scheme by ministerial order? It relates to people earning just over €580
Does it make sense?
In the new year, the first Irish patients will finally get access to medicinal cannabis products
This is to be welcomed
More than 40 people, however, still have to leave the country to collect their prescriptions
Reimbursement is not guaranteed and it would seem to be very arbitrary when it comes to the criteria
One such person, Ms Pamela Fowler, has given me permission to speak about her son today
Ryan Fowler has a condition called Gardner's syndrome, with desmoid fibrosis, and his family was granted a ministerial licence this summer
They were told some weeks ago, however, in a letter they received, that his prescription would not be reimbursed
Ryan's mother has said to me that his life has been transformed because of cannabis due to the chronic pain he goes through
He is now faced, however, with the prospect of not being able to afford the prescription
How is this fair?
Jigsaw's statement earlier in the week was very disappointing, to say the least
It would be an understatement to say that the matter has been handled very poorly by Jigsaw management since it arose
It is a question of maintaining mental health provision in north Clondalkin and the wider Dublin Mid-West
If the Jigsaw service in the area falls through, Dublin Mid-West, including Clondalkin and Rathcoole, will not have any mental health service provision, which will be a bad day for young people in the area
We call on the Minister of State, Deputy Daly, to intervene, given that 84% of Jigsaw's funding comes from the HSE
That is a great deal of money, yet it has made a decision that is good for the centre rather than for young people
The decision is deeply regrettable
If it were not for Jigsaw, which provides a great service in Dublin and across the country, many people would not be here at this time
This decision has been a bad one from the outset
It cannot be overturned without Government intervention
I reiterate that 84% of Jigsaw's funding comes from the Government
The Government has a say
It must override Jigsaw's decision to pull out of Clondalkin

I commend the Endometriosis Association of Ireland, whose representative spoke in the audiovisual room last Tuesday
I thank Kathleen King, Aimee Brown, Sarah Moloney and Jean Sutton
Their testimonies enlightened me and many others at the presentation
One in ten women is diagnosed with endometriosis
That is nearly 135,000 women in Ireland
On average, it will take nine years to get a diagnosis
As a person who had very little knowledge of the condition, I find it truly shocking that so many women can suffer in silence and that it takes so long for a diagnosis of endometriosis
Some women have to travel abroad to Romania or Britain, not only for surgery but also for fertility treatment
Endometriosis has almost become the Cinderella of our health system
It is largely forgotten
I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Daly, can shine some light on this issue for the women who are suffering in silence
It is welcome that, under the women's health task force, endometriosis will be reviewed and so forth
I think, however, that most women looking at this debate tonight will ask why it has taken so long to address this issue
There is a paternal narrative in healthcare and over the past two or three years, in particular, we have seen women being let down completely, not only by the health system but by society as a whole
If we can do anything as legislators or Teachtaí and hold out solidarity to our sisters today, it is to state that we will do as much as we can to try to put this on the national agenda

I am glad we are having this debate today
Numerous Deputies have spoken about this issue
Today's report on the south inner city was a critique of the inner dynamics of criminal gangs and how their insidious behaviour affects communities
The picture is pretty bleak
Children as young as ten or 12 are exploited and involved in the drugs industry
There is still light, as the author of the report said, with regard to going from antisocial to pro-social behaviour, which is very important
I am quite outspoken on this issue
There are two vacuums that create this situation
One of them involves socioeconomic reasons while the other one manifests itself in the criminal justice system and State policy on drug use
Children being caught in the drugs trade by unscrupulous individuals is not new
I know of instances in Dublin Mid-West where children as young as 12 are selling crack cocaine, heroin and all sorts of illicit drugs
This is deeply depressing
Children are selling illicit drugs to adults and are being put in harm's way through that
Through the lure of money and the apprenticeship of glamour, the souls of these children are being taken away by unscrupulous individuals
The level of manipulation and the grotesque violence that come with it constitute an affront to society
This is nothing new
There is an alternative economy in working-class communities - a black economy - where people do extremely well out of drug dealing
They make vast amounts, which trickle down to the middle layer
It is a bit like the capitalist economy
There are the main ones who make all the money and usually do not live in the area and then there is middle management and a floor of factory workers and people beneath them who do all the work and must take all the slack
The collateral damage of that is communities being destroyed by drugs
There is no way of getting around it
There is no glamour involved in drugs yet people still take them
As Deputy Curran said, the demand for drugs has never been so great so something is obviously wrong here
We have powers under the Misuse of Drugs Act under which if people use drugs, they will receive custodial sentences sometimes
Obviously, that is not working
We must look at something very different because if it is about demand and supply, there is huge demand out there
All sorts of people use drugs
There are probably people in this Chamber who have used drugs
I have used drugs in the past and I have said that publicly
Other people have used drugs so this goes on and we need a rational and grown-up debate about why people turn to drugs for all sorts of complicated reasons
Using the criminal justice system as a bulwark against people is simply not going to work
We must look at something very different when it comes to how we treat people who use drugs and how they supply drugs
We need to look at regulating all drugs
Probably a lot of people will disagree with me on that but I would look at a policy that is very different because once that vacuum exists, people will fill it
They will be extremely unscrupulous and once that vacuum exists, this is what will happen
People Before Profit will be supporting this Bill
The Minister of State, Deputy English, will agree that the rent spiral is out of control, and when something is out of control, it needs to be stopped
We are at 20% more than peak rents in 2008
We all know what happened in 2008
Even by comparison with 2011 when it was trough rents, rents are 40% more now
Rents are completely unsustainable at present
I had a look on  I want to mention the housing assistance payment, HAP
Not only are landlords discriminating against tenants on HAP, they are looking for homeless HAP
They drive up rents so much that they get more than €2,000 because people are desperate and the Government is giving this money out to landlords
A report earlier this year showed that one in ten people in Ireland is spending over 60% of his or her income on rent
This is completely unsustainable
All this is having a corrosive effect on society
Not only are three generations living in houses but also 10,000 find themselves in homeless accommodation because of the perfect storm of the policy of no public housing and rents going through the roof
I agree with the Minister that not all landlords are bad
There are some accidental landlords who, for certain reasons, have a house to rent etc
There are some decent people out there
However, the over-reliance on the private market, super landlords and other landlords has distorted everything and has created a situation where it is completely unsustainable
Government policy, regardless of whether or not the Minister of State, Deputy English, likes it, because he has been in government for the past nine years, has created this crisis
The Government has created a crisis where rents are completely unsustainable
There are three ways that will be tackled: a rent freeze, rent control, and the Government being shown the door
The Government will have been in power for nine years come February
In that time, the housing crisis has become incrementally worse
If the Government was a business or any sort of commercial enterprise, it would be run out of town
However, we are not talking about a business but about people who have to endure a homelessness crisis that has been compounded by various phenomena and successive Governments
It is not a natural phenomenon for 10,000 people to be homeless
It is the most unnatural phenomenon one can comprehend
More than 10,000 people do not have a house
They are in emergency accommodation
It is quite incredible
A mantra has echoed around this Chamber that we cannot make the same mistakes of the past
I find that hard to get my head around
The mistakes of the past involved us building public housing on a massive scale, which has largely been very successful
It gave working people a house to call their own and has been transformative
I find it hard to comprehend how this could be considered a mistake
The Taoiseach goes on about how it is not about ideology, but it is
Why would the Government want to sell public land to private developers when we have the greatest housing crisis in the history? Think about it
It does not make sense
If we have a crisis, one would think that we would build rental, affordable and public housing on public land rather than sell it to private developers
It is hard to understand
The Government has also created the conditions compounding this crisis, particularly around vulture funds and property speculators
Other issues around people accessing council housing involve income thresholds
Income thresholds are far too low
Many people want to access public housing but cannot
They are discriminated against because they work
The thresholds should be far higher
I would go as far as to say that people earning €80,000 or €100,000 should be able to access public housing if they wish
There should be no barrier to that
I do not know if the Minister knows of a man named George Clarke, who is a presenter and architect
He is running a really good campaign in Great Britain around council housing
He was brought up in a council house in the 1970s
A total of one million people are on the waiting list for council housing there
The right to buy scheme has seen millions of council houses sold off without being replaced
He said "we desperately need a new generation of well-designed, genuinely affordable council houses for those in most need"
He says that "in 1919, the Government’s 'Addison Act' gave local councils the power to build thousands of new homes across Britain after the First World War" so this is something that goes back 100 years in Great Britain, which has a significant history of building public housing
At the same time, we have a tradition in this country where it is normal for 10,000 people to be homeless
This policy is a complete failure
It is to be hoped the general election in the new year will see the end of this Administration
I am grateful this Topical Issue matter has been taken
The subject, access to medicinal cannabis where there is a medical need, has caught the Irish public's imagination over the past three and a half years
I have been quite vocal about it
The Minister of State will have to agree that this has been a very protracted process to provide legal access to medicinal cannabis in Ireland
Three years ago almost to the day, the majority of Deputies voted to allow the regulation of cannabis Bill I introduced go forward
That was a milestone in this debate on access to medicinal cannabis
Time is of the essence for people who need this medication
Over the period since that milestone, people have been forced to go abroad, to go to the black market or to go without
It is quite galling that people to whom this could be beneficial have to go without
The announcement last week that two cannabis-based products will be rescheduled will not make a major difference to most
People will still be forced to go abroad under licence, to go to the black market and to go without
A six-year-old boy called Asseel Osman lives in New Ross
He has cerebral palsy with complex features
I have spoken to his dad many times over the past year
His dad has said to me that his son only knows a life of pain, but the administration of cannabis has made this young boy's life much easier and much better
The tragedy, however, is that Asseel's father is still forced to go abroad, still possibly breaking regulation
It is pretty immoral that people are being criminalised and forced to go abroad for a substance that could be beneficial to them
It is welcome that these two products have been rescheduled
It is a significant medical milestone in Ireland that two products that contained CBD and THC can now be prescribed by consultants
That is to be welcomed
I have been quite critical of the medical cannabis access programme, MCAP
It is too restrictive and the bar is too high since it is consultant-led rather than GP-led
The conditions for the programme do not stipulate chronic pain and that is very controversial
The best research is available for cannabis use to treat chronic pain
It is welcome that these products are available
People who are listening tonight will wonder when the programme will be up and running, when these products will be available and who is educating consultants about prescribing medical cannabis
Most consultants have said that they know little or nothing about the subject
It is imperative that the people who prescribe these products know about what they are prescribing
One does not have to go university to know that
It is something that the Department of Health should examine
It is welcome but we need to understand when this will progress for the people who could benefit from medical cannabis
Can the Minister of State finish?
That is quite a long and detailed statement
It is informative for the people who are listening
I am somewhat concerned about some of what the Minister of State said, especially at the end, that this is not expected to be available in Ireland for a further period
How long is that further period? That is slightly worrying
People have been waiting for three years for these products to be approved
It is important that people get access to these products
People are being forced abroad and to the black market
They are also self-medicating, which is not appropriate or suitable, but when one is desperate, that has to be done
Regulation is very important
Is the Minister of State saying that most of the 31 licence holders will be reimbursed? People were previously getting the licence but were not being reimbursed, which caused serious hardship for the families
I welcome that, if people are getting the licences, they will automatically be reimbursed
What people have to do is somewhat bizarre
They have to go to a different jurisdiction with a licence and bring the product back four times a year
There is no other drug in the world for which this has to be done because of the stigma and rubbish relating to cannabis
Will the Minister of State clarify when this programme will be up and running and how patients can access it? Will she address the education of consultants who prescribe these substances? How do they educate themselves and interact not only with the Department of Health but patients themselves?

I want to try to be as constructive as possible, but that is difficult when-----
I am trying to be constructive-----
-----but it is difficult in this debate when one sees the stark reality of what parents have to face
Children who need intervention are being failed, which is the key word I will use
I do not doubt the Minister of State's bona fides
Rather, I am stating the facts, and the facts are that children are being failed on a grand scale
Parents are being forced to bring the Government to court because it is breaking the Disability Act
They have the stress not only of looking after their own children and seeking interventions, but of bringing the Government to court
Some parents are also being failed because they must go to the private sector and spend significant amounts of money
In some cases, they must remortgage their houses just to get interventions for their children
If a child gets early intervention, regardless of what that intervention is, the outcomes can be very beneficial, not only for the child's development, but for his or her parents
The stark reality is shown in the figures I received in reply to a parliamentary question I tabled a number of weeks ago
I wish to record the reply on the Dáil record
My parliamentary question related to waiting times for specific interventions in CHO 7, covering parts of Dublin, Wicklow and Kildare
The reply is stark
The waiting time for an assessment of needs is 15 months
Children have to wait 15 months for an assessment of need, not to mention an actual intervention
This is contrary to the provisions of the Disability Act
The waiting time for speech and language therapy for children with special needs is two and a half years, as is the waiting time for psychological services
The waiting time for occupational therapy for children with special needs is 20 months while the waiting time for physiotherapy is 18 months
The Minister of State cannot defend that; he cannot defend a situation where parents with children who need interventions have to wait that long
He knows that the stress that comes with such waiting is incalculable
The fact that parents and their children are unable to access necessary interventions within a reasonable timeframe represents a complete failure of this Government
This has been going on for the last seven or eight years but it could have been fixed
The welfare of children is paramount, whether we are talking about children in emergency accommodation, in direct provision or those who are disadvantaged by social exclusion and poverty
It is not their fault that they are homeless or that they have to wait two and a half years for an intervention
Parents are the voice for their children and we in this Chamber are the voice for the children who cannot speak up for themselves
If they could speak here, they would say that this Government has failed them miserably
Four months ago, the Misuse of Drugs (Prescription and Control of Supply of Cannabis for Medical Use) Regulations 2019 came into effect
For the first time, this gave Irish-based doctors the opportunity to prescribe medical cannabis products
Since then, nobody has been prescribed any products whatsoever
I received a text message from a woman in recent days
In it she said:Hi Gino, just to say thank you so much for campaigning for medical cannabis as I am going through chemotherapy at the moment and will have to buy cannabis on the black market
It is the only thing that stops the sickness and horrible pain that goes through my bones
This is so, so, so wrong
What is wrong about this is that the cannabis-based products that could be helping this woman and many others are actually imported into the State but nobody can access them
When will the medical cannabis access programme commence which will allow people get proper access and stop having to go to the black market or even worse have to go abroad for medical cannabis products?
It is happening, however
When?
Most people believed we would have a general election before the by-elections
It is probably a bellwether indicating how people feel about the incumbent Government
After the end of the month we will know the results
Kellie Sweeney will be the People Before Profit candidate in Dublin Mid-West
She is the youngest candidate to stand in any of the four by-elections
I first got to know Kellie during the Dublin Mid-West campaign to repeal the eighth amendment
She played an amazing part in that campaign
She had not been involved in too many campaigns before and she really cut her teeth on that one
It was an honour to work with Kellie
As a nurse, she knows only too well the challenges for nurses in this country but also the challenges facing the health system
Some people come to activism by accident and others by choice or necessity when there is something wrong and they want to correct it
They are not inspired to sit on these seats but to change things that they know are wrong in society
There are many things wrong in society, especially in the context of housing, the health service and the direction in which Ireland is going
Kellie is a fantastic person
She is not a politician
I do not consider myself a politician
We are activists
She is a mother, a nurse and a voice for working-class people
If one has that, one has everything
I welcome this important debate on the issue
It has been debated numerous times since I became a Deputy
The drugs industry is one of demand and supply and the demand will always exist in society whether we like it
The recent debate on decriminalisation of drugs for personal use was beneficial but it did not go far enough
Anyway, that is probably for another debate
Policy change in recent times favours a health-led approach rather than a criminal justice approach and that is welcome
The drugs task forces have been around for the past 20 years
Those involved have been at the coalface of dealing with issues relating to drugs in communities
There is a major concern among those involved in the drugs task forces that their involvement is being overlooked in favour of a more centralised approach
I believe this would be a retrograde approach
Another aspect of this is class
Working class communities have been disproportionately affected by drug use
When I was growing up in Clondalkin, I had many friends at school who began to dabble with drugs when they were teenagers
That led to devastation for individuals, families and communities and the legacy lives on today
The scale of the devastation can only be measured in terms of the destruction of lives
The policy of using the criminal justice system to tackle drug use has largely failed
I wish to express an opinion about drugs with which people may disagree
We must have a completely different approach to drug use and how we deal with people who use drugs
Some people use rather than abuse drugs and live perfectly happy lives
There are people who use drugs recreationally who have both jobs and families
As Deputy Kelly said earlier, the level of cocaine use at the moment is incredible
The demand for cocaine is incredible and all the laws in the world will not stop people supplying drugs to those who want them, including cocaine
Recreational drug users exist
There are many people in every sphere of life, from every class and background, whether rural or urban, who will use drugs but they are not criminals and should not be criminalised
It is their choice to use drugs and they should not be morally judged for doing so
We need to have a major discourse about the deregulation of all drugs
That is probably not palatable to some people but the prohibition on certain drugs has largely been a failure
The drug laws in this country are completely out of date
Cannabis is a widely used plant and drug that should be regulated, taxed and legalised
This would take it out of the hands of criminal gangs
We should regulate, tax and control it as other countries, like Canada, have done
New Zealand is to hold a referendum on the regulation of cannabis
Certain states in the USA have regulated and legalised it and the sky has not fallen in
We must have a debate on the legalisation of cannabis because anything that takes people out of the criminal justice system is worth considering
The vacuum of prohibition and non-regulation has created an alternative economy where vast profits can be made by criminal gangs who use absolutely grotesque violence and intimidation against their own communities
That is the vacuum in which we live, where illicit drugs, which are illegal, are still readily available and people are using them
There is something wrong here and no law under the sun can tackle this
We need to look at taking a radically different approach in terms of the law, health and society itself and public opinion is ahead of politicians on this issue
Ireland has matured and is more liberal in its outlook, particularly with regard to the use of drugs
I am not trying to glamorise this in any way because I have seen from my own family how drugs can destroy lives but we need a completely different approach
It is not necessarily going to be nice because there is a dark side to all of this but we need to do something different
Legalisation is not a panacea by any means but if it saves one life, then it is worth doing because at the moment, we are losing the war on drugs
I wish to ask the Tánaiste about the proposed review of income thresholds to qualify for social housing
Thousands are being discriminated against because of their income
They are lucky enough to earn a certain amount but they are being discriminated against because of it as they are being told they cannot apply for social housing
Over the past five or six years, thousands have been knocked off the housing list because they earn an income above the threshold
The review has been going on for the past two years
When will it conclude?
Last May 82% of people voted in favour of changing the timeframe for those applying for a divorce in this country
It is incredible to think that 23 years ago in 1996 the difference between "Yes" and "No" was 9,000 votes
It was a very different Ireland
I am probably showing my age, but I remember campaigning for the yes side
It was a very different Ireland
It was a pivotal moment for those who were in abusive relationships
They had a way out
The people of Ireland spoke and said that people should have a choice
That change did something else which was more fundamental and its legacy survives to this day
It challenged the Catholic moral conservatism that is in this country
Of course, a person can be Catholic or Christian and so forth, but the straitjacket of that conservatism was finally lifted
That day started a process that challenged the church and the conservatism that we lived under during that period
It changed fundamentally
I welcome the move to reduce the waiting time from five years to two years but I will speak contrary to that
My amendment would go further and stipulate a six-month period
The reason is that I believe people can make a decision
It is a difficult decision for people when they are in a relationship and it breaks down
It can be complicated
It is not because I believe people should get out of a marriage on a whim - far from it - but as consenting adults I believe they should have the legal right to separate under this procedure
It should not be up to the church, the State or this House to dictate or impose restrictions on a legal divorce involving two consenting adults
That is why I will be pushing my amendment today
I move amendment No
1:In page 4, lines 27 and 28, to delete “two years during the previous three years” and substitute “six months during the previous twelve months”
Four months ago Spinraza was approved for 25 children with spinal muscular atrophy, SMA, in this State following a very protracted campaign by parents and a number of Deputies in this House
However, the children have not yet been given access to Spinraza
Patients and their parents have contacted Deputies in this House
They are very frustrated with the whole process
Spinraza has been approved for these 25 children, but with winter approaching, they still do not have access to it
When will they be given access to Spinraza?
Hopefully, the Minister can bring some clarity to this issue because there is considerable concern about the possible closure of this initiative
As Deputy Ó Broin noted, this initiative has been running for the past 25 years and has given children suffering from social and educational disadvantage an opportunity to access different services so it is imperative that it continues
I am from the area and relatives of mine have used the project and found it very worthwhile
Could the Minister clarify the funding mechanism for the Get Ahead Club, be it through the school completion programme or otherwise? It is important that she clarifies matters
I am none the wiser after the Minister's contribution
Is it a governance issue, a funding issue or community employment issue? I am confused
Hopefully the Minister can shed some light on this
The most important thing is that this project continues
In addition, there must be confidence in the staff and among the people who use the service
If there is a cloud of ambiguity around this, it will cause confusion
The Minister needs to give more clarity about the funding arrangements and the governance issue
As Deputy Ó Broin stated, any governance issues must be teased out
However, the most important thing is that this project is properly funded, and we need clarity on its funding in the long term

I am sure the Tánaiste will agree that what is unfolding in north-east Syria only compounds the misery of the Syrian people and the persecution of the Kurdish people
It has the potential to create more internal refugees in Syria
Some 60,000 people have already left the affected zone in northern Syria
In a quite incredible statement for a member of NATO and a President of Turkey, President Erdoan stated on Turkish television that he will flood Europe with millions of refugees if the European Union taunts Turkey regarding its interference in Syria
More than 500,000 people live within 5 km of the Syria-Turkey border
The Tánaiste will agree that foreign interference in Syria has created a quagmire of human misery
Some 500,000 people have been killed there in the past eight years
This is one of the worst civil wars humanity has seen
Given the events of the past three days and, in particular, the green light given by President Trump, it is ironic that the Syrian Democratic Forces, SDF, which were trained and armed by the Americans and were fighting ISIS, are now being battered by the Turkish military
This is a betrayal of the Kurdish people by the Americans
What can Ireland and the European Union do to address the situation?
This situation has the potential to escalate into a regional war
In terms of the geopolitics of the area, there is a significant Kurdish minority in Turkey as well as Kurdish minorities in Iraq and Iran
The history of the Kurdish people is one of absolute persecution
They have been bitterly betrayed by the Americans, although that is no surprise for the Kurdish civilians as the Americans have bitterly betrayed many people, having interfered in foreign policy
One practical thing the Tánaiste can do is to summon the Turkish Ambassador to ask him whether he will take responsibility for the civilian deaths which are occurring on his watch
There is blood on his hands

The budget has been neutral and has not wasted a good crisis
What was supposedly a surplus budget has turned into a deficit budget for the majority of people
It has used the spectre of Brexit to fig-leaf a lack of real gains for working class people
This budget of political choices has favoured raising carbon taxes rather than taxing the real polluters in society
Carbon tax was introduced ten years ago
Since then, the number of cars on the road has doubled
The idea, therefore, that carbon tax changes behaviour is rubbish
It is a stealth tax, which does not change behaviour whatsoever
There are alternatives to carbon tax, a good example of which is a tax on commercial air fuels in Europe
I believe that most people do not know about the concept
If a tax was applied to air fuels in Europe, it would reduce emissions without having much effect on jobs at the companies in question
If it was levied on Irish airspace, it would generate €900 million per year, which would be underpinned by legal action to prevent companies from passing on the increase to their customers
Such a measure is possible but there is no political will to take it
The Government has deferred the 30% increase in the hourly minimum wage for workers
Some 137,000 workers earn the minimum wage, many of whom are women, migrant workers or lone parents
Another example of political will is that there is no prudence in respect of extending and maintaining tax breaks for senior executives of multinationals
Some 1,000 executives have a special tax arrangement called the special assignee relief programme, SARP
Eight of them earn salaries of between €3 million and €10 million, which is obscene
This tax break costs the Exchequer €28 million per year
I could comment further on loopholes in the budget and the tax avoidance that such individuals and companies practise
It amounts to a great deal of money, which could offset carbon tax or address the housing crisis, for example
On housing, I find it hard to believe that the State will invest a further €80 million in private landlords
Next year, €1 billion will be given to private landlords
You could not make this stuff up
Landlords currently chase rents to inflationary levels, meaning that they do not even seek HAP anymore but rather homeless HAP
This amounts to more than €2,500 per month, which the State pays while lining the pockets of private landlords
It is incredible that it is going on but it is the policy and ideology of the Government
The Government is not for turning but what I have just outlined needs to be changed quickly
The country is very wealthy but the budget compounds the wealth inequality and the ongoing related crisis that is experienced daily
It is a budget of the extreme centre
The Taoiseach commented on the hard left but I find that somewhat offensive
I am a socialist, not of the hard left
We do not appreciate being called derogatory names by the Taoiseach
This will be the final Fine Gael budget of this Dáil
I hope workers will remember that Fine Gael is no friend of theirs
It is stroke politics
In June this year, the Minister for Health introduced a protracted medical access programme for cannabis
The Taoiseach and Members know that this followed a very lengthy process
To date, no cannabis has been prescribed
The medication is in the country but medical practitioners cannot prescribe it
People want to know when the medical cannabis access programme will commence
I know that this issue predates the Minister of State's tenure and dates back to the late 1970s
I do not believe this situation would be tolerated in any other workplace or occupation
The facts are stark
About 300 or 10% of school secretaries are entitled to holiday pay, sick pay and pension entitlements
Therefore, the Department of Education and Skills is discriminating against 90% of school secretaries in State schools
It is ironic that this is taking place in cradles of learning - schools
This is very bad not only for the secretaries but also for everybody involved
Last week Fórsa organised a one-hour stoppage which was supported not only by their colleagues - the other 10% - but also by the teacher unions, parents and, most importantly, students
It is a great anomaly that amounts to pay apartheid in schools and the secretaries want the Department to address it immediately
The Department of Education and Skills believes it would be premature to engage with the union on the stoppage that happened last week
That is slightly odd because this issue has been ongoing for 41 years
If the Minister of State was to find that a colleague of his was on higher pay for the job they were doing, it would cause him grievous mental torture
It is an odd statement for the Department of Education and Skills to make
Some 90% of school secretaries are being discriminated against, while a further 10% of their colleagues who are employed directly by the Department of Education and Skills are receiving much higher financial rewards
This issue needs to be addressed urgently or there will be further industrial action in the coming months and years

May I move our amendment?
It is good that we are having this debate
This issue has been debated many times over the past three and a half years
The motion is comprehensive
It identifies what is good in the system of special needs provision in Ireland and the faults therein
Like other Deputies, during the summer months I was contacted by many parents on this issue
The stress endured by parents in accessing provision for a child with special needs is incomprehensible
The fact that there is no provision for them when they need it is unforgivable
This has been happening
I do not wish to be completely negative and I note that over the past decade, there have been improvements regarding SNAs and ASD units
I am very familiar with one unit in St
Peter Apostle junior national school in Neilstown, which is a really good unit for which there is over-demand
It is a really good way to allow children with special needs to source education in a mainstream school
As the system seems to be based on postcode or seems to be arbitrary when it comes to ASD units, there is a crisis under way and a need for special needs provision
In one case, children had to wait two and a half years for ASD provision, which is unacceptable in 2019
We must uphold a child's right to an education
It cannot be just about containment
It must be a meaningful education where children can flourish like any other child
They should not be discriminated against because of their needs
The financial hardship endured by parents sometimes goes under the radar
"Prime Time" exposed not only the stress but the financial blow-back experienced by people with regard to their mortgages and their own relationships when provision was not there
It comes down to the "R" word - resources
I know money is being thrown at this issue but we need more money and resources
This should be seen in the wider context of special needs provision in Ireland
Other Deputies and I have frequently said that under the Disability Act 2005, the Government is breaking its own law
Parents are bringing the Government to the High Court because it is breaching its own legislation, which is incredible
It is happening because of the lack of both assessment of needs and provision of speech and language therapy, psychological assessment and occupational therapy
It is remarkable that this has been allowed to happen in quite a wealthy country
Other individuals have stated that provision is needed but it comes down to resources
Hopefully, the Minister can get the ear of the Minister for Finance and tell him that this situation must be addressed immediately
No child or family should be left behind because every child is the same in this country
I raise the issue of the proposed VAT rate on vitamins and supplements in the upcoming budget
A decision in this regard was deferred last March
The Tánaiste will probably not comment on the budget and is not privy to the finer details
Supplements and vitamins currently attract a zero rate of VAT
If the 23% rate is applied to them, this will place an unfair financial burden on many people who use them
The VAT rate on fast food is 13
5% but the Government wants to apply a rate of 23% to vitamins and supplements that are good for us
This does not make sense
Perhaps the Tánaiste will comment on the matter
Will he ask the Minister for Finance not to apply this rate of VAT to vitamins and supplements?
We finally had some good news last week concerning the medical cannabis access programme
This issue stems from a situation with the primary care reimbursement service
It is an arbitrary and, at worst, highly invidious system
Two weeks ago I raised with the Taoiseach issues being experienced by two families
I am referring to the Kelly and Stevens families
It is no coincidence that they were reimbursed the next day
It was because they had been forced to go public
The family whose situation we are concerned with today also has a heavy financial burden to bear
They can afford the costs of treatment for their child, Killian, in the short term but not in the long term
It is important that the Government intervenes
It is true
I know but it is true
The section of the programme for Government relating to youth mental health provision refers to extending "these services, such as Jigsaw, which is free to access and does not require GP referral"
Earlier this year, Jigsaw decided to pull out of Clondalkin, where it was covering a huge area for young people, including Lucan and Palmerstown
That decision was a huge mistake and Deputies Curran and Ó Broin are saying that too
Hundreds of young people will gather in Clondalkin tonight to protest against the decision that has been made by Jigsaw
Young people want to know what provision will be made for mental health services in Dublin Mid-West if Jigsaw moves away from Clondalkin
I commend this motion and fully support it
I would like to show Solidarity's support to over 300 An Post workers who are facing job losses
Our solidarity and support go out to them today
This closure will have a detrimental effect on them, their immediate families and the economy
Commercially, this decision does not make sense, as the commercial figures show that An Post is in good shape
The company reported revenues of €900 million last year, which is an increase of 7% from 2017
Stamp and meter receipts are also up 20%
The use of stamps and parcels is very productive for An Post, so this does not make commercial or strategic sense
As other Deputies have stated, this closure is a reflection of An Post's shift from a State company to a semi-State company and then to a commercial entity
That was borne out in the closure of post offices in rural areas, which has had a hugely detrimental effect on many villages
Responsibility for this lies squarely with the management of An Post, not the workers who have served the centre in Cork very well for the past 16 years
We are calling for An Post to reverse this decision because of the detrimental effect it will have on the workers
Will other conditions be included in the medical cannabis access programme?
This has been a long journey and the end of that journey last Wednesday, when we finally saw the law being changed and people being given access, was one of the proudest days in my time in the Dáil
I am contacted daily by people who want to see progress on this issue
To be fair to the Minister, he wants to see progress
We probably differ on certain issues but we got there in the end
It has been a brutal, protracted process
An issue that has been raised over the last three years is the omission of chronic pain from the guidelines, especially from the HPRA's scientific report
The efficacy of cannabis for chronic pain has been well researched
It is viable as a substitute for opiate-based medicines
In the five-year pilot project, will other conditions, especially relating to chronic pain, be added to the programme?
The current licensing system, under which 21 licences have been granted, is cumbersome and is not workable
The majority of the licence-holders cannot be reimbursed
Last week, I raised the cases of two families who have to spend more than €10,000 a year
They have to travel to Holland four times a year to get a prescription
I do not think there is any other drug or substance for which people must leave the State if they wish to bring it in under licence
That is somewhat bizarre
When Britain changed the law on 1 November, medical cannabis could be prescribed for chronic pain as part of the programme
Under the Danish system, which we are seeking to emulate, neuropathic pain is part of the programme
I know that chronic pain is a broad term
When one considers that one person in six suffers from chronic pain and 40% of those who suffer do not have any relief whatsoever from opiate-based medicines, because of the crisis in the over-use of opiates, not only in Ireland but across the world, medicinal cannabis should definitely be a viable option for the very many who suffer excruciating chronic pain

I wish to ask about the recruitment and retention of staff in the healthcare system, particularly in light of last week's strike by 10,000 healthcare staff
Will the Minister comment on this issue?
I am a former hospital worker, and the Minister will appreciate it when I say that hospital workers are the glue that holds hospitals together
Clerical staff, porters, care assistants, chefs and other hospital workers of that magnitude keep hospitals afloat
The crux of the dispute relates to moneys owed to these 10,000 workers
The matter goes back to 2015 and the job evaluation scheme introduced under the Lansdowne Road agreement
The HSE and the Department of Health agreed that the pay increases recommended under the job evaluation scheme should be paid to the workers
The workers are asking for moneys owed to them in respect of changed job responsibilities and descriptions over that period
They are asking for the money to be paid to them now, rather than at a later date
There is significant frustration among healthcare staff, many of whom I know
They are very frustrated with the process
They held off and took the pain over the years of austerity
They want what is owed to them
The HSE and the Department of Health stated that they agree with the outcome of the job evaluation scheme
The money is owed to the workers
One way or another, the matter will be resolved
It must be resolved by giving the workers the money owed to them because if it is not, strike action will continue
If the Department of Health and the HSE stated that under the job evaluation scheme the workers are entitled to the money, why is the money not being given to them?

I am pleased we are having a debate on this topical issue, which has been debated at length in this Chamber
It is good that we are having the debate today
The Mental Health Commission's report makes for very sombre reading
About an hour ago I read some of the observations made by the commission
I will refer to four
If they do not worry people, then nothing will
The first relates to physical restraint and seclusion
The report states that just 19% of centres were compliant with the relevant code of practice
The second is that 40% of approved centres were non-compliant with the regulations on the need for individual care plans
The third relates to a shortage of mental health staff, which comes under the narrative relating to the retention of staff
Even more worrying is what was said about 24-hour supervision in approved centres for young people
The commission's observation is that the residences are not regulated and leave residents open to the risk of abuse
The report, to say the least, is unbelievably grim
I do not blame the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, personally, because I do not make things personal
The report is very worrying for young people when they access mental health services
The observations get worse
The report stated that 70% of approved centres were poorly maintained
Some of them were not even fit for purpose and 40% were non-compliant on the need for individual care plans
Something is dramatically wrong if individual care plans are not provided for the young people in the care of the centres
Nearly 84 children and adolescents were admitted to 18 adult units this year
It is quite incredible that this is going on
The levels of compliance and deficits in care are very worrying
The absence of regulation leaves residents open to abuse
The report makes bad reading for young people listening to the debate tonight
As other Members have said, there is a crisis in the health service and in mental health services in this country
In some ways the staff are trying to do their best, but the lack of retention of staff is having a big effect on the delivery of the service
In my constituency we received two pieces of bad news about mental health services
The adult mental health services in Clondalkin is due to close and to move to Tallaght
To compound that, the Jigsaw youth mental health service in Clondalkin is also to move to Tallaght
Along with other Deputies from the constituency, I indicated that it was a significant mistake to move Jigsaw from Clondalkin
It is a successful service and it does not make sense to move it to a different area
I hope the decision will be reviewed
A Vision for Change was visionary in some ways, although it was gathering dust for 13 years
It was visionary to state what we need to have in a mental health service that complies with the 21st century
We are nowhere near that
Having read the observations, the onus is on the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, to review fully mental health services for young people in this country because the report is damning
It is up to the Government to address it
The medical cannabis access programme was announced by the Minister for Health today
Obviously, it has been a protracted process, but it is welcome
It is significant for the health system as doctors can now prescribe cannabis-based products
I commend the families who have been campaigning for this in the past three years, in particular, Vera Twomey and Paul Barry
The country owes that family a debt of gratitude for the sacrifices they have made
While the programme is welcome, it does not go far enough, in particular with reference to the stipulation surrounding the omission of chronic pain
Many will ask why a reference to chronic pain has been omitted from the programme
Will it be included in the access programme in the future?
This was debated at length several weeks ago
The issue of the embargo on home help hours is not going away
The announcement by the HSE on the moratorium on additional hours until November will have a detrimental effect on home help services in the community
This is probably directly linked to the overspend in the health budget and the overspend on the national children's hospital
They are causing a chain reaction which has affected community home help hours
I worked as a home care worker for ten years
During the last debate I spoke as a care worker about how vital the service is for the client, the family and all that entails
I referred to public health nurses, palliative care and end-of-life care
When somebody is quite ill or coming to the end of their life they want to be in the surroundings of their home
That is the future and that is what we need to do
I wish to allude to the motion itself
It is a really good motion and points out that directly employed home help is more cost-effective than always looking to the private sector
The private sector has a large slice of this pie and it is very lucrative, even though the workers themselves are non-unionised and are sometimes not that well-paid compared to a directly employed worker
The HSE pays private operators an hourly rate which is almost twice what the workers get
With a directly employed carer the money goes to the worker rather than a private operator
I understand that the Minister of State is setting up a statutory scheme, which is welcome
However, the most controversial part of that is co-payment
We may not agree, but I think that will be quite controversial
Other Deputies have alluded to the waiting list of 6,000 people
I can guarantee that those 6,000 people will need home help provision and intervention
That could mean anything from 24-7 care at the top end to 20 hours or sometimes one or two hours a week
It is very important that we engage in these things
I welcome the fact that there has been a 45% increase in the budget for home help hours over the last three years
To be non-partisan, that is really welcome
It is really important that the moratorium is lifted and the number of hours budgeted for increases
Primary care in the home is the future
There is no doubt about that
People want be cared for at home
That is better for the clients and for society as a whole
Last Wednesday, I tried to raise an issue related to the cannabis access programme with the Taoiseach
On Friday, I received a reply to a query I made to the Tánaiste five weeks ago
He did not get back to me at the time, and I got this reply five weeks later
That is completely disrespectful to me and the people and families who have been campaigning for access to medicinal cannabis
The Taoiseach's behaviour on Wednesday was outrageous
I want to note that
I seek clarity on this issue
A family contacted me on Thursday in relation to their daughter, Lucia, a five year old from Sligo
They have sought reimbursement for medicinal cannabis but have been turned down and have to sell the family home to pay for the future healthcare of their daughter
It is outrageous what is happening to families and people who are trying to access medicinal cannabis
I ask the Taoiseach again, in all sincerity, when the cannabis access programme will start because the families and the public want to know
I am very disappointed to hear the dreaded words "the money message" used again against the majority will of the Dáil
This place goes from bad to worse when it stifles the democratic will of Deputies
It is extremely disappointing
There is also an element of scaremongering in the Minister's statement
Some of it can be quite credible but other stuff is quite bureaucratic and scaremongering
I congratulate Senator Gavan and Deputy Brady for bringing forward the Bill
It has brought light to the hospitality sector with regard to tips
For my part, I thought tips would naturally go to the workers but that does not happen for one in three employees in the hospitality sector
People would consider that grossly unfair
Most workers in the hospitality sector are non-unionised and have precarious work and precarious hours
It is important, therefore, that the tips are fed down to the workers to subsidise their wages
That brings us to another argument, probably for another day, about a working wage in Ireland
Most workers in the hospitality sector will not earn that
That is another battle we need to fight on another day
Other Members have mentioned that not all employers are bad
However, there are employers who abuse the tip system to their own ends financially and to rob workers of a fair gratuity paid by the customers for their service
It is important that this Bill gets across the line
One scratches one's head sometimes because one comes into this House to try to make a difference but whenever one tries to do that, a minority Government in this House tries to stifle the will of the majority of Deputies
Most people watching these proceedings will be quite confused and angry that this is being done continuously to stop progressive Bills and matters that could be very progressive when it comes to workers' rights
It is important that this Bill go forward, but the concept of the money message is stifling democracy in this House
I want to follow up on Deputy Micheál Martin's question
It is two and a half years since the report came out
It was commissioned by the HPRA
Its main recommendation was that the cannabis access programme be set up
Since then, there has been no access programme
In the past two and half years, 16 licences have been granted to 16 individuals in the State
Of those 16 licences, three have involved financial reimbursement
There are, therefore, 13 other families who have not been reimbursed
A family contacted me over the past few weeks
Mary and Joe Stevens, who live in Waterford, were granted a licence last December for their daughter, Cassandra, and they were given notification yesterday by the HSE that they would not be reimbursed
The cost is €9,000 per year
The family still has to go to another jurisdiction, namely, Holland, to get the medication
As of August, however, the family will not be able to afford the medication for their daughter
According to their words and the clinical notes, we have learned that the product has made a dramatic difference to the daughter's life
This is so important
I have been banging this drum for the past three years
I am so frustrated
My frustration does not compare with the frustration of the families
Is there a commencement date for the cannabis access programme?
That is terrible
That is absolutely terrible
For three years-----
Surely the Taoiseach can give a better answer than that
That is terrible
I have been banging this drum for two and a half years and the Taoiseach gives an answer like that
That is unbelievable
It is so disrespectful
I do not think there is anything in the thrust of the motion with which we would disagree
There are major issues in the Defence Forces over morale, pay, conditions and retention of personnel
For far too long the Defence Forces have been forgotten in the public service debate because of their special status
I consider personnel in the Army and the other Defence Forces to be working class like any other worker
There would be outrage if any other set of workers, especially those in the public sector, were treated the way they have been treated, especially in the past five or six years
Some of the conditions they have had to endure have been despicable
It is good that the Defence Forces are marching
Families of the Defence Forces are highlighting the issue
Deputies are highlighting the issues that the Defence Forces are enduring
It will be interesting
People will look at what the Public Service Pay Commission says
The leaks to date suggest the commission does not go far enough
One recommendation on which we are all likely to agree is that PDFORRA and RACO will be affiliated to ICTU
Members of the Defence Forces should have union representation
Sometimes the issue is that union status is not recognised by the State, preventing them from undertaking collective bargaining for their comrades
It is important that we have this discussion
I hope the Public Service Pay Commission will recommend better pay and conditions for those in our Defence Forces
I speak not as a politician or an activist but as a carer
I was a carer for 15 years before I came into this place and worked as a home care worker for ten years
The service is vital for the family and the client
It has a huge place in primary care and in a health service and the announcement of what is almost a moratorium on home care hours is very unfortunate
This will be detrimental to people who get the service at the moment and to the 6,000 people who are waiting on home care packages and are in vital need
They are coming out of hospitals and need care to stay away from hospitals
The Minister spoke about putting home care on a statutory footing, which would be good
It would mean people were entitled to a certain number of hours of home care per week under the law of the State
A patchwork of private companies run home care at the moment, which is something I have a problem with because it is disjointed
If we were to put the service on a statutory footing it would be beneficial for the client, the patient, who is the most important person, their family and the workers
I would be grateful if the Minister would say what he means by putting the community care provision on a statutory footing
Many home care workers are not unionised and are underpaid
A home care worker will probably earn about €10
50 per hour, while a private company charges the HSE double that amount
They make huge amounts of money out of HSE contracts and this needs to be looked at
I will not labour this point
Could the Minister of State tease out what a model of home care and community care on a statutory footing would look like? It is important and welcome
I know the Minister of State cannot foretell the future but what would such a model look like? Would it be underpinned by legislation? What would it give to the people who are being cared for? Does it give them legal rights? Unfortunately, in Ireland, the Disability Act states that there is a statutory right for children to get assessment of needs but that is broken on a daily basis
One can be sceptical
Can the Minister of State tease out what it would look like in the future for clients, families and the workers?
Will it be means tested?
I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for taking this Topical Issue matter today
I hope there can be some clarity on the confiscation of cannabidiol or CBD products around Ireland
Many people are confused about the legality of CBD products
Even I am confused on what is legal or not legal
In recent months some shops in the country have been raided, for the want of a better word, by the police and the Customs and Excise
They have confiscated CBD products such as CBD flower, CBD tea and CBD oil
This is a great inconvenience for the shop owners because they are not breaking any law
This stems from the law and in particular, the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977
There is no exception whatsoever for tetrahydrocannabinol, THC, trace amounts
This is where we run into trouble
The shop owners are perfectly legitimate and law-abiding
They are selling products that are perfectly legal but obviously there is a situation whereby the interpretation by some arms of the State, in particular, the Customs and Excise and the police, contravenes that of other arms of the State, namely, the Health Products Regulatory Authority and the Food Safety Authority
The latter authorities maintain there can be trace amounts of THC in CBD products of up to 0
That is the background
Some of these shop owners will possibly face criminal sanction and thus the stakes are serious indeed
If the police of this State interpreted the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 by the letter of the law, then there are shops not far from here on Grafton Street that are selling CBD products with trace amounts of THC at 0
If that is the case, then the manager should be questioned by the police
There is a major contradiction in this regard
Many people use CBD products and find them beneficial for their well-being
This is putting them in a situation whether they do not know whether they are breaking the law
This is a mess and I hope the Minister of State at the Department of Health can bring some clarity
I have a document to hand from the Department of Health
I understand there are proposed amendments to the 1977 Act to provide for inclusion of trace amounts of THC up to 0
That would give clarity because there is no clarity whatsoever around this issue at present
I hope the Minister of State can elaborate on that point
The problem lies in laws that were written 42 years ago
They have not been updated to reflect what people are doing at the moment, including CBD shops and CBD derivatives
There has almost been a boom in production of these products during the past two and a half years
I hope the Minister of State can give some clarity for the people who are listening
Many people are looking and listening to this segment in the Dáil tonight to see where they are going, as shop owners and people who use CBD
I hope they will not be criminalised
That does not answer my question
I am sure the police of this State have better things to be doing than breaking people's doors down to confiscate products that are not illegal
I reiterate that what these shops are selling is not illegal, but at the same time, these products are being confiscated
There is obviously a contradiction in the law, and there is a contradiction in the arms of the law
The Minister of State is still not answering the question
The document I have from the Department of Health states: "It is envisaged that national legislation will be amended in the future to exempt finished products containing trace amounts of THC at levels not greater than 3%
" Is the law going to change, or is it not? Is this going to continue, because it will continue and will get worse because CBD products and cannabis derivatives have become very popular? People use them and find them beneficial
The lack of clarity on this issue is making it confusing for shop owners and those who use CBD products
Is the law in this regard going to be amended? The World Health Organization, WHO, stated in January that it should be amended
Even in the European Union, subsidies are given to farmers for hemp under the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP
Cannabis is not as dirty a word as it used to be, and we should embrace cannabis as a drug, a plant, and for all its purposes
Can the Minister of State comment on the amendment of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 in regard to cannabis?

I raise an issue in respect of proposed changes to the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977
Currently, there is no legal exemption under that Act for any amount of tetrahydrocannabinol, THC, a cannabis derivative
It is proposed by the Department of Health in a document which I have here that this will be amended to exempt products containing trace amounts of THC at levels not greater than 0
In the past two weeks, a number of CBD shops around the country have been raided by the police
Their interpretation of the 1977 Act is contrary to what the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, and the Food Safety Authority say about THC products which are at 0
These shops are not selling anything illegal and the shop owners are not doing anything illegal
Will the Minister give a commencement date for the change in the law? This is important because there is confusion regarding CBD products
There is much confusion on this issue
Will the Minister of State give an indicative date of commencement?
I welcome the debate on the adaptation grant because it affects everybody who needs provision for housing adaptation
I am sure everyone will agree the current process in most local authorities is highly cumbersome
It needs to be streamlined, while the guidelines for the adaptation grant should be clarified because they are quite bureaucratic
Anecdotally, there have been cases where people who needed modifications have died while waiting for the grants to be processed
That has happened in the area covered by South Dublin County Council to individuals who waited for more than two or three years for essential work on their house but who died in hospital while waiting for their application to be processed
That is not good
The funding for the adaptation grant was reduced from €95 million to €71 million this year, which has a knock-on effect for local authorities and, more important, people who avail of the grant
In South Dublin County Council, €2
5 million is provided for private tenants, which is oversubscribed, as it is for council tenants
The waiting time is two years for a stairlift or walk-in shower, which are essential forms of adaptation
Without them, people cannot leave hospital, while if they live at home, they must sleep downstairs because they cannot go upstairs
I turn to the criteria for the grant
The maximum grant is currently €30,000, although I am sure the Minister of State will correct me if I am wrong
I have done some calculations with that figure
If two parents earn the average industrial wage, it will put them over the threshold in South Dublin County Council
While the average industrial wage is no great shakes, if both parents earn it, or above €60,000, they cannot avail of anything - not a penny
Despite potentially having a child with special needs, they will not receive any money through the grant, which is deeply unfair
The thresholds and income disregard should be much higher than they are, which goes to the crux of the issue
Some people are disadvantaged because they work, while others do not work but are nonetheless at a disadvantage because they cannot have the necessary works done
It is important to reconsider the means test, the threshold and the income disregard because as time passes, people wish to remain at home rather than move to institutions or hospitals
That is how community care has developed and will continue to develop
I am glad we are having the debate and hope something can come out of it
I have been a Deputy for three years and know that while issues such as this are often discussed, sometimes nothing ever happens
I hope that through the Bill, along with the Minister of State's amendment, circumstances can be streamlined and improved for everybody to whom they apply
The question I raise today came up numerous times when we were canvassing in the past seven weeks and relates to crèches turning away babies and toddlers in favour of preschool children that are seen as more lucrative
This issue arose many times on the doorsteps while we canvassed in the past few weeks
In one case, a parent had contacted 25 providers in Tallaght and Clondalkin and still could not find a place for her child
The Minister has stated previously that successive Governments have under-resourced and undervalued childcare in Ireland
This problem is caused by providers that see the provision of childcare for toddlers as more lucrative than that relating to babies
The Minister has indicated that, under the NCS, a subsidy of €5 per hour will be paid in respect of every baby
Is that amount too little? Does it help make financial sense for childcare facilities to provide places for children under the age of one?
In some cases, average childcare costs can equate to mortgage repayments
Some parents are paying up to €1,500 per month for childcare, which is completely unsustainable in the short and the long term
The provider of childcare has to be subsidised by the State
If the subsidy is €5 per hour and the baby is in crèche for 36 to 40 hours per week, it would amount to approximately €800 per month
If the average cost is €1,400 then €600 is paid by the parents
Are the subsidies too low? The Minister is asking for €50 million to plug the black hole relating to the NCS next year

I wish to ask the Minister about the crisis of continuing childhood homelessness and the impact it is having on the 4,000 children in emergency accommodation
As Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, what are her views on it?
I do not doubt the Minister’s sincerity when it comes to this issue, but the facts speak for themselves and the fact is that since this Government has taken office in 2016, child homelessness has increased by 70%
That is more than 1,800 children in emergency accommodation
As the Minister stated, it has had a profound effect on each child and on their families, who are in a completely unnatural environment
As an Independent Member, who is not affiliated to Fine Gael, has the Minister thought of withdrawing her support for the Government? It is obvious that the Government’s policy on housing and giving shelter to citizens of this country is profoundly wrong and is going nowhere
Child homelessness has risen exponentially in the past three years
Has the Minister considered her position in supporting the Government?
The Minister has run out of superlatives when it comes to this crisis
It is obvious that the current housing policy of the Fine Gael Government is an abject failure and not only for the 10,000 people in emergency accommodation
The vast majority of people find that figure absolutely staggering
Somebody has to bear responsibility
The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs must surely have had sleepless nights in the last three years in respect of the 4,000 homeless children
It is not her fault personally but it is the fault of the Government she upholds

I wish to ask a question that I have asked countless times in this Chamber
It relates to the cannabis access programme
I hope the Tánaiste can give a definitive date for the commencement of the programme because I am contacted on a weekly basis about it by parents and patients who need access to medicinal cannabis for their children or themselves
People have been waiting for the programme to commence for the past two and a half years
Could the Tánaiste give a definitive date for the commencement of the cannabis access programme?
It is hypocrisy
The Labour Party has sold out
Hypocrisy
Absolute hypocrisy
It is hypocrisy every time
It is absolute hypocrisy
The Labour Party was part of it
It is sickening hypocrisy
It is absolutely sickening
It is absolutely nauseating
Behind the statistics there are people and behind the people are children
The report of the Ombudsman for Children, published today, gives a glimpse of what life is like for children in hubs
A hub is an unnatural environment for children
Their environment should be a home setting, where they can close the door after them and go to school
When the abnormal becomes normal we have a serious problem
This constitutes the institutionalisation of children in the 21st century
In the past there were mother and baby homes, now there are hubs, bed and breakfast accommodation, and hotels where children live
The report states that 800 children live in hubs in Dublin alone and 900 nationally
That does not include over 3,000 children living in emergency accommodation, bed and breakfast accommodation, hotels, and hostels around the State, which is absolutely shameful
We have debated this so much that I feel I am hitting my head against a wall because the Government does not seem to be acting
At the moment, there are 1,800 children in direct provision, a very unnatural environment for them and their families
That has to be a shameful stain on our society
Other Deputies have mentioned young people coming out of care and trying to find accommodation, which is probably next to impossible
There is a dearth of accommodation, particularly one bedroom apartments around the State
If a person is coming out of care, there a danger that he or she will become homeless or, even worse, enter the criminal justice system because there is no place for him or her to sleep at night and to call his or her own
It is a pretty awful position for that cohort of society
I want to get to the crux of this matter
As I and other Deputies have asked, why is the State in a position where 10,000 people are in emergency accommodation and why have "social" and "housing" become dirty words? It was the policy of Fianna Fáil, the Labour Party and Fine Gael over the past 15 years
They have dirtied the words "public housing"
I asked the Deputy two months ago if the Labour Party would sell public land in Clondalkin and she stated that it would not
What happened? The public land was sold to a private developer
That was absolute treachery
The crux of the matter is that we have commodified public housing
It is the reason we have a crisis on our hands
If the Government cannot provide shelter, it does not deserve to be in office
As I indicated to Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, as long as the Government has a policy of selling public land to private developers at the height of a housing crisis, that crisis will remain with us perennially until the policy changes
I wish to raise the long-term illness scheme
To most people's amazement, the long-term illness scheme has not been reclassified since 1970
This was 49 years ago, which is a long time considering that many conditions have been diagnosed since then such as severe asthma, rheumatoid arthritis or conditions like fibromyalgia
A strange situation pertains to fibromyalgia, which is a chronic condition
Fibromyalgia is recognised as a long-term disability in the North but not here
Are there any plans for a review of the long-term illness scheme for other conditions, including chronic conditions?
I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing this very worthwhile debate on an area of huge interest to me
It shows commitment to solidarity with the most vulnerable people on the planet, whether they are threatened by conflict, famine or environmental catastrophe
Across the world there are many people who volunteer through NGOs or from their own altruism to go across the world and help their fellow human beings
That is to be commended, whether it takes the form of volunteering, teaching or engineering
There are many ways that people try to give to their fellow human beings across the world
It is very commendable
The backdrop to this discussion is the gap between the richest and the poorest people on the planet
That has never been as stark as today
As other Deputies have noted, a recent poll shows that 80% of those surveyed felt that Ireland should increase its support for efforts to eradicate poverty
The people of this country have a long history of empathy with others who have been dispossessed and traumatised by conflict and famine
As a people, we can empathise with that
We are very generous when it comes to overseas development
Our generosity has been reflected in recent decades
I welcome the debate on the percentage of gross national income spent on aid
At the moment that figure is 0
3%, which amounts to €800 million
I understand that we are trying to reach 0
7% by 2030
That is to be welcomed
Our contribution should be much more than it is now
That would significantly help overseas development
I want to comment on something in which I have a personal interest
I was in Mozambique in January and I made it my business to go to the Irish embassy in Maputo
The Irish ambassador was in Ethiopia at the time so I met the embassy staff on my second last day there
They discussed what they were doing in Mozambique
They have a fantastic project with a small budget
We had a very good and very long discussion about where the money is going and what it is developing in Mozambique
It is an incredible country
The hospitality of the people of Mozambique is incredible
What has happened in recent weeks with Cyclone Idai is terrible
I welcome the Minister's contribution of €1 million to help with a disastrous situation in Mozambique
The people's hospitality and warmth were incredible
I am very proud of what I was shown in the embassy
Irish Aid is trying to make a small difference in Mozambique
It is an incredibly large country with a lot of issues but it is heartening to see what Irish Aid does considering its relatively small budget
There is a darker side to aid
Other countries offer aid for geopolitical reasons
It takes the form of loans rather than outright aid
We must comment on that
We do not want countries to be completely dependent on aid
Dependency on aid can be counterproductive in encouraging growth
Aid should be temporary, helping countries to come out of poverty and desperation
It should be a helping hand rather than a way of pushing people down
There is a lot to be said about multinational companies that have plundered the resources of these countries
They have thrown these countries into desperate states of poverty and marginalisation
They have a lot to answer for in this debate
The granting of aid to recipient countries can be very cynical
There are a lot of vested interests in the aid given to some countries
It comes with a price tag, usually pertaining to geopolitical reasons or attempts to grow trade with a wealthier country
It is not perfect by any means
Ireland should reject conditional aid
NGO workers are sometimes the last line of defence
They are at the front line of catastrophic situations around the world
I have been very lucky in my life in that I have travelled a fair bit
I was in East Timor in 2006 and I saw how Trócaire was intervening
From speaking to people in that country, I know how grateful they were
Countries like Ireland have a great reputation for trying to help people who are fighting terrible injustices
That is very welcome
We have a very good history of that
At the end of the day, however, we need to challenge the reasons for the terrible poverty in the world
Until we challenge them, this situation will continue
We need to increase our contribution to 0
7% of gross national income
I wish to raise the proposed cannabis access programme
I understand that an importation licence has been granted to a company for medicinal cannabis products
That is welcome news, as this situation has been dragged out
I have two questions
When will the programme be set up? The programme's current guidelines are extremely restrictive and many people will not be given access
In November in Britain, medicinal cannabis was rescheduled to schedule 2, yet few people can get it
We do not want the same to happen in Ireland
I welcome everybody in the Public Gallery to this important debate
I thank the Business Committee for agreeing to take statements on fibromyalgia, which is an important subject
I presume this discussion has been arranged on foot of the motion on the issue I submitted last week
I am disappointed with the number of Deputies who have turned up thus far
Many people are watching and listening to this debate and, more important, waiting to find out what the Government will do to address the issue
It means a great deal to many people who have this condition and they want to know what we, as legislators, will do
For far too long, there has been an unhealthy silence on conditions such as fibromyalgia and myalgic encephalomyelitis, ME, which are all too invisible in the case of those who live with them
Although this is a cliché, people look perfectly healthy but inside they have to suffer from the chronic pain and fatigue that comes with fibromyalgia
While this debate has moved on in recent years, people who suffered from fibromyalgia, particularly women who are more often affected than men, were written off medically as hypochondriacs or, worse, people suffering from psychosomatic disorders
This was an insult to the sufferer and the condition
I thank Ms Rachel Lynch and Ms Ursula Hakman from FibroIreland who have helped me understand fibromyalgia
I did not have much knowledge of the condition or of ME
Through their knowledge and experience, they have helped me and others to gain a greater understanding of the condition
I hope today will be the beginning of a much wider debate on fibromyalgia and its recognition as a disability in the State
Bizarrely, given the current discussions on Brexit and the artificial Border in this country, fibromyalgia has been recognised as a long-term condition in the North since 2016
If fibromyalgia can be recognised in the occupied part of Ireland, why can this State not recognise it? There is an ongoing debate in Britain on its recognition and while it is progressing, it has not yet gone far enough
Fibromyalgia must be recognised as a disability as this would result in patients having better access to services and medications and better dealings with the social welfare system
There are horror stories about people with fibromyalgia and ME being put through the ringer by the system
If fibromyalgia is not considered to be severe enough, the sufferer has to fight the system, which can make the condition even worse for those who live with it
Other Deputies alluded to the long-term illness scheme
It is extraordinary that not one condition has been added to the scheme for 49 years
Surely fibromyalgia fits the bill for being added to the long-term illness scheme
The only reason I can think of that it is not on the long-term illness scheme is funding
It is as simple as that
While those with the condition may have a GP-only medical card, they must cover other expenses such as therapy and medications
It is ridiculous that the scheme has not been extended in 49 years
While that is a separate issue, it is incredible
Fibromyalgia is recognised as a condition in France and has been included on the country's long-term illness scheme, which means patients can get medication and so on
There is major misunderstanding of this condition and addressing that is half the battle
The reason for this debate is to create a greater understanding of the condition because misunderstanding compounds fibromyalgia
To dismiss the condition is unforgivable
I am no expert on fibromyalgia and I can only try to put myself in the shoes of somebody who has worked with chronic pain and fatigue
I cannot imagine that kind of constant pain
Relying on opiate-based medicine is not desirable and the long-term side-effects are completely detrimental
Alternative medicines should be found, particularly for treating chronic pain
Other Deputies have implied that it is extremely disappointing that with respect to chronic pain and the proposed access programme, medicinal cannabis was not suggested as a treatment
That is extremely disappointing
I hope we can get one thing from this debate
We can have flowery debates and great speeches with nothing ever happening
After these statements, will the Minister of State meet a representative of each party so we can progress this matter? We are Deputies representing many people in this country who have fibromyalgia
Will the Minister of State meet representatives of each party in the next two to three weeks?
Yes it is
The Minister is like the invisible man these days
On a point of order, we are making statements rather than discussing the motion I have in my hand, but I request that the Minister of State ask her colleagues in Government to take up this motion and table it themselves
They may choose to modify it, but it really goes to the crux of the matter we have been discussing
I appeal to the Minister of State to bring the motion back to her colleagues so that Government can table it and so that we can get consensus on this issue
I commend Deputy Funchion and Sinn Féin on tabling this motion
She has done sterling work in this area
It is appropriate that we discuss this issue on World Autism Awareness Day
Awareness is crucial to understanding
In the past, autistic adults were institutionalised, marginalised and, at worst, hospitalised in this country
Thankfully, society's approach towards people with autism has improved and there is more inclusion and understanding
It has been autistic people themselves and their families who have changed misconceptions about autism
Their life experience and testimony has given us a better understanding of autism
There are still enormous barriers in society for autistic people in employment, education and support needs
Autistic people can live perfectly productive lives
Many of the barriers which autistic people face come from how society responds to them, which is quite inadequate
Early intervention is crucial to children and the current delays in diagnosis can have an enormous impact on a child's development
Many children find themselves in very long queues for crucial supports
Families are forced to seek private services or else face waiting years for early intervention
The Disability Act 2005, which provides that children be assessed within three months, is failing so badly that families are bringing the Government to the High Court for breaking its own legislation
It is extraordinary that parents must drag the Government through the courts to secure early intervention
It is incredible
We can have very good speeches in this House and the Government can say that it is doing its best, but the figures speak for themselves, as others have noted
They are damning of this Government and its predecessors
In 2008, 1,143 applications for an assessment of needs evaluation were not completed within the statutory three-month period
By 2017, the figure had risen to 2,154, and by October 2018, 3,662 were overdue
Potentially thousands of families could bring the Government to court because it is breaking its own laws
It is an extraordinary position in which the Government has placed itself
I will conclude on a positive note
Today, one of the most inspiring activists of our time wrote on Twitter that she was "proud to be on the spectrum"
Most people will know this young Swedish school student, Greta Thunberg, who has been campaigning for climate justice
She also said that for most autistic people "it is an endless fight against schools, workplaces and bullies" but given the right supports it "can be a superpower"
This is a pivotal moment in respect of climate change and the environment in Ireland
To try to stop this Bill would be unforgivable
The Government and its agents have done everything to subvert the democratic will of this House and this Bill
The skullduggery and tomfoolery of what is going on has been absolutely shocking
The process has been rigged from the very start to subvert that process
It is not the first time
Other Bills have been subverted, particularly in respect of medical cannabis
Other Bills from Solidarity-PBP have been subverted
New politics seems a very distant term that was bandied around this place
It seems very antiquated and jaded
I have said before that there is a democratic deficit in this House where the majority of Deputies who want to see popular legislation for the will of the people, this has been always subverted
I would go as far as to say this Government has lost its legitimacy to rule
Many people are looking on and asking about the effects on the environment
As Deputy Bríd Smith said, there has to be a reason the Government is so adamantly opposed to the Bill
It is clear that the reason is there are vested interests, particularly oil companies, which have the ear of the Government
The majority of people want decisive action on the environment by supporting this motion
The slogan of the environmental movement has been one of system change, not climate change
To challenge that, we have to challenge the elephant in the room, which is capitalism
Capitalism is the source of all the evils of environmental catastrophe and vandalism
The pursuit of insatiable profits by oil companies and by the big multinationals in the world has brought the planet to the brink of a catastrophe
Until we challenge that we will skirt around the edges of the environmental movement
This comes down to ideology
Fine Gael's ideology is wedded in the market system and capitalism
The main thing that the environmental movement going for it is mass movement
Greta Thunberg and the many people who have been at the protests over the past 11 days have been calling for environmental action
Climate action and environmental justice are the new civil rights of a new generation
This generation has become very politicised and radicalised in respect of environmental issues
They are not going to accept the ways of the past
There was a misconception that environmental issues were the preserve of a few people in the upper echelons of society
That has fundamentally changed
It is the preserve of the many of the people on this planet
If the Government is the few, well, the few is up
We have to change this planet and we have to change the ideology that comes with it
I am disappointed the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, is not here
He seems to be the Scarlet Pimpernel of the Dáil these days
My question relates to the families who have to leave the jurisdiction to fill a medical cannabis prescription in Holland
It is an onerous and unworkable imposition
I await the reply
I am sure the Minister of State will agree that this situation which requires people to leave the jurisdiction to obtain a prescription is ludicrous
I cannot think of any other medicine in respect of which a patient or nominated person must travel to another jurisdiction to bring a filled prescription back
It becomes even more ludicrous
A family in Newtonards in County Down who have given me permission to speak today do not have to go to Holland as a distribution company brings the medicine to a named pharmacy for them
In the case of Vera Twomey, however, her husband Paul has travelled to Holland in the last two months
The pharmacy there told him the prescription could not be filled for the next six months
It is a completely unworkable scenario in both the short and long term
Most people listening to this discussion will not understand this
Given that 16 licences have been granted to 16 individuals in the State, one would think the State would intervene to provide a distribution company to go to Holland and bring the product to those 16 individuals' pharmacies
That would be the logical thing to do
Currently, the cost of reimbursing the travel and the inconvenience are very stressful for the families
The substantive issue is the cannabis access programme which has been mooted for the last two years but is still not up and running
Individuals continue to have to go their specialists who will say in the majority of cases that they do not know enough about the product and situation to prescribe it
It is an unsustainable situation
The access programme must be implemented so that people do not have to leave the jurisdiction but can get the medication in their local pharmacies while being reimbursed by the HSE
When will the programme be up and running?

It has still not been done
It is clear from the motion and the statistics that the consumption of drugs is increasing, both nationally and globally
The demand for and use of drugs are greater than ever before, particularly for certain drugs
It runs in parallels with the upsurge in the economy
On a personal level, I have seen what drugs can do and the devastation they can cause to individuals, families and communities
We will have to have a grown up argument about why prohibition has failed
Drugs are destroying communities, but the market for drugs has been surrendered to individuals who only care about profits and making as much money possible
This raises the question of whether we should do something completely different from what we are doing
The consumption of drugs is increasing and prohibition is simply not working
The debate about decriminalisation in the context of the national drug strategy will continue
Decriminalisation should have happened 20 years ago and should happen today
It should be done and implemented properly because putting people through the criminal justice system just does not work
In fact, over 40% of the people incarcerated are in prison for cannabis use
Anybody listening to this debate should know that nobody should be in jail for cannabis use
That drug should be legalised immediately
The pharmaceutical industry presents another issue
I read an incredible statistic which I had to check and re-check
Last year 32,000 people in the United States died from a Fentanyl overdose
That is one person every 20 minutes which is absolutely incredible
Some 70,000 people in the United States died of a drug overdose last year, which is astonishing
These drugs are legal
They are in a package which can be bought in a pharmacy
Pharmaceutical companies that make billions and billions in profits are allowed to continue to operate unchecked and cause the social damage we have seen
We need to look in new ways at the catastrophe drugs cause
Decriminalisation is very important
Drugs will be with us forever
No matter what we say, people will use them and it does not matter what laws are in place
A new approach is required
We need the regulation, decriminalisation and legalisation of certain drugs
That debate has to happen and it will be a difficult one for some, but if it is about saving lives, we should look at the Portuguese model
In 15 years thousands of people have been saved from death and the criminal justice system
I note that the new strategy looks at holistic ways of dealing with drug addiction and drug use
That is good and what we should be doing
However, decriminalisation should happen today
It is seven and a half years since Shane O'Farrell was unnecessarily killed
There is indisputable consensus in this House that Shane O'Farrell would be alive, and perhaps nobody would have heard of him, if there had not been a systematic catalogue of failures by all parties, including the police and the courts
What the family have always looked for is accountability, truth and justice, and they form very simple narratives
This scoping exercise will not get to that truth
The truth will only come out through a public inquiry
The need for a public inquiry on the unnecessary death of Shane O'Farrell will come out after the scoping exercise
As my colleagues have stated, this issue has become so protracted that it now compels the O'Farrell family
The family has always wanted truth and justice
Will the Minister be compelled to establish a public inquiry if Judge Haughton calls for one?

I wish to raise access to the drug Spinraza for 25 young people in Ireland
A number of Deputies have raised this issue in the last nine months
I understand the HSE leadership met on Thursday to give a final decision for the families
I was speaking to Lisa McHugh Farley in Clondalkin and her son Glen is eagerly awaiting access to this drug
The 25 families want to know what the decision is very quickly because this has been a prolonged process
I am shocked at some of the statements that the Labour Party and Fine Gael are coming out with today
We cannot dress this up any other way
This motion provides more nails for the coffin of Irish neutrality
The Minister of State spoke about the European Defence Agency in the Oireachtas Select Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Defence
To paraphrase, the Minister of State referred to a force protection programme, a chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear protection programme; enabled Defence Forces; counter improvised explosive device neutralisation manual projects; surveillance networks projects; security levels; cyberresilience; satellite communication aims for Defence Forces and international crisis management operations
I put it to the Minister of State that this does not read as a peaceful organisation
It undermines the whole basis of Irish neutrality, which is being eroded motion by motion as this goes on - as Deputy Ó Snodaigh has said
The Minister of State's party and Government seem to be very happy to go along with the militarisation of the European Union
It is measures such as this motion, PESCO and the EU status of forces agreement, SOFA, that are compromising Irish neutrality
At a time when people seek more accountability and democracy, the European Union and the Government have given us more militarisation and conflict
This Chamber should conscientiously reject the motion because, no matter what people say, it is the precursor to the European army the EU wants
The supermarket of the European Union needs a European army
We must conscientiously object
The Minister of State has talked a load of rubbish for the past five minutes
I am not sure whether the Minister was at the march on Saturday but a few of us were and it was probably one of the best marches I have been on for a long time
The only comparison I can make with Saturday's march is the anti-water charges marches
There was a great atmosphere
I do not think any workers have the same respect among the public as nurses
The level of solidarity and support for them was second to none
There is an unbreakable bond between the nursing profession and the public and that was borne out by the public support over the three days of the strike
I speak from first-hand experience, as I was a care assistant for 17 years before I was elected to this House and I worked with nurses in many hospitals and various other care settings
Nurses play an extremely important role in society
They are extremely professional and passionate about their job
That is what it comes down to: they do not do it for the money; they do it out of a sense of commitment to their fellow human beings and to try to help them as much as possible
Nurses do not want platitudes
They want attitudes to change in the Government about pay and retention in their profession
Nurses were very reluctant to go on strike
They wanted to be on their wards caring for people but they were forced to take action because this is a safety issue
This is a pay issue
It is an issue affecting our whole public health system
It goes to the heart and soul of their profession and what we are fighting for in public life
What does it say about society when nurses have to go on strike while the Government paid bondholders €270 million in November, gives tax exemptions to banks and puts bankers on a pedestal? Meanwhile nurses do not get a fair hearing
The substantive issue has not gone away
That is recruitment, retention, pay and conditions for nurses
If hospitals are not safe places for nursing staff, auxiliary staff or care assistants they will become dangerous for patients and patients will die
We will wait and see what comes of the Labour Court recommendation
We will take our green light from nurses themselves
The indications are that this does not go far enough and does not address the substantive issue of retention and pay parity
Nurses do not ultimately want a pay rise
They want to be respected and paid like other allied professions
Nurses have crossed the Rubicon and there is no going back
For too long they have heard platitudes from successive Governments and they have stood down
As Deputy Coppinger said, it largely comes down to the fact that nursing is a female-dominated profession
They have crossed the Rubicon and it is time for the health professions as a whole and the public health system to stand side by side with the nursing profession because when they win, we all win
I take issue with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform's statement on the Public Service Pay Commission
What he said goes to the heart of this dispute
He said that the commission found that pay was not found to be one of the determining factors
Does he believe this anymore because pay, retention and respect for nursing staff are at the heart of this dispute? We could have a three-day dispute in our hospitals next week that will cause untold damage to the Government and the people who use the health service
This is about pay
The Government needs to recognise that if it does not pay the nurses, that decision will come back to haunt it, so it cannot afford not to pay the nurses
Does the Minister still believe what the Public Service Pay Commission said? Is this not about pay?
I raise an issue I have raised on numerous occasions over the past two and a half years, that is, access to medicinal cannabis
Kenny Tynan is a father of four from Roscommon who a number of years ago was diagnosed with a brain tumour and last year was granted a medicinal cannabis licence by the Minister
Unfortunately, that licence did not involve reimbursement
Somebody, in the interim, has paid for the first three months of medical cannabis
Obviously, that person cannot continue to do so, putting Mr
Tynan in a stressful situation for his family
The substantial issue is the medical cannabis programme which was proposed two years ago
As of yet, there is nothing
This programme is not up and running
If the programme was up and running, reimbursement would be guaranteed, as would access
There are families who must leave the jurisdiction to go to Barcelona to get medical cannabis for their children
As Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone is quite progressive on this issue
Is there a date for the programme?
We could not argue with any of the content of the Labour Party motion
In the 100 years since the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil child inequality is now, as it was then, compounded by social class
This is a "C" word we should use more often
Disadvantage is determined by political policy and postal address
Class or location should never define a person’s ability to thrive but class is an economic reality
The consequences of class-based society mean that 130,000 children still live in consistent poverty
This disproportionately affects single parents and Traveller families
This was compounded by the policy of the then Minister, Deputy Joan Burton, on the one-parent family payment in 2012
Many lone parents will never forgive or forget the Labour Party for those cuts
Those deep cuts were social vandalism by the Labour Party, which is supposed to represent working people
The party stabbed people in the back
Those who live and work in the low-wage economy are the working poor, which also affects children
Other consequences of the class-based society are the nearly 3,500 children who live in emergency accommodation
Anybody would find it quite extraordinary and shocking that 3,500 children have no home but a hotel to live in
This is completely unacceptable
The trauma of this for those children is incalculable
I do not know how the Government Deputies can sleep at night when they know that 3,500 children do not have a home
There are also waiting times for essential services such as the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, and for speech and language therapy and occupational therapy
In relation to the scandal of CAMHS, some children have to wait for up to two years for assessment
It is incredible vandalism to visit on children in a society
Incredibly, parents are now bringing the State to court on foot of the Disability Act which this House passed in 2005
The Act provides that children must be assessed within a certain period, but the Government cannot meet its six-month deadline
The Government is actually breaking its own laws
That is where children are at today
What does it say about Ireland and the political establishment? What about child poverty and its effect on every individual? Revolutionary socialists must act on the political upheaval in society
Child poverty, homelessness and long waiting times cannot be allowed to be normalised
Tackling child poverty is a task for revolutionary socialists and the people out there who can address this crisis
The Labour Party gave it all to the banks
Deputy Burton caused great damage
She should apologise
Fair enough
I want to start with a comment the Garda Commissioner, Drew Harris, made about the report to the Policing Authority
It is reflective of the debate we are going to have
Commissioner Harris said that we should have done better by young people who were "in the main, vulnerable children"
That says everything about the report
The motion touches on some serious incidents that happened between 2010 and 2012
It is obvious to anybody who has read it, or who has read about the failings of the Garda youth diversion project, that there were governance failings of a serious nature, which one could only call systematic and institutionalised failures on behalf of the programme and the police themselves
Some of the offences that were committed and never prosecuted through the criminal justice system were heinous crimes
It was a catalogue of failures from the beginning to the end for both the victims and the children involved
Other Deputies have touched on this, and this is not to demean or trivialise the people who were the victims of these crimes, but I was shocked to read, in the motion, that 57 of the children accused of offences have died since 2010
Those children are gone
They must have lived chaotic lives if that was the outcome
Everybody will agree that is shocking
There are 105 youth diversion projects in Ireland
I will refer to two with which I am familiar in the area of Neilstown where I am from and where I grew up
There was not a lot to do there for young people
There were no community facilities and some people got in trouble with the police and so forth
The GRAFT and VALLEY projects are in operation in the north Clondalkin area and their rate of reoffending is extremely low
Those programmes engage with many people who are referred by juvenile liaison officers
These projects have been good at diverting people away from the criminal justice system
There are also late night football leagues in Dublin and other counties, another initiative of the youth diversion project
Late night football leagues exist in 16 counties and they are positive
They provide indoor and outdoor football facilities for children and young people particularly on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays between 8 p
and midnight
They have been successful in getting young people away from vulnerable situations
We need to go further than the motion
We must look at the grave inequalities in society and issues which disproportionately affect working-class communities
A mistake that people in society make is to demonise young people
It is wrong to associate anti-social behaviour with young people because young people then grow through their early adult years thinking that everything they do is anti-social
What the banks did to this country is much more anti-social than the behaviour of young people
We need to challenge the inequalities in society and that is something that will not be done by a motion or an inquiry
That has to be done politically
It is good that we are having the debate and, hopefully, the failures of the police will never happen again
Very well
I know
I thank the Tánaiste
It is important that this issue be flagged
The prison in question is the Ofer Prison
It is one of the most notorious prisons in the occupied West Bank
There are 1,200 Palestinian prisoners there at the moment who have been incarcerated without trial
There are also 180 child detainees in the prison
As the Tánaiste referred to, more than 150 prisoners were injured last week, some with rubber bullets
At the moment a hunger strike is taking place in response to the actions of a special forces unit called the Metzada unit
The unit is a quite brutal force of the Israeli Prison Service
The Tánaiste should signal to his counterpart in Israel that human rights abuses by the Israeli authorities should not be acceptable under any terms
I would appreciate if the Minister could convey that
He is probably on the vitamins

It seems incongruous that the Minister of State is proposing to put 23% on all vitamins, minerals, fish oils and food supplements
This move will have a profound effect on those who take vitamins as part of a health programme
It will also disproportionately affect older people
It will also have a profound effect on the many health food shops which will struggle to open because of this proposed hike
A number of people who take supplements and vitamins as part of their health regime contacted our office over the weekend
They stated that if this proposed VAT hike is implemented they will not be able to sustain their need for supplements and vitamins on their income
That is not their fault
The condition has chosen them, but that measure will disproportionately affect them
I understand the Minister of State has discretion as to whether to implement this hike
There is major public opinion on this issue to the effect that if he implements this, it would be akin to putting VAT on children's shoes in the 1980s, and we saw how that ended up in terms of a Fine Gael Government
He should have a serious rethink about it
There is precedent
In 2014, there was a proposal to put VAT on herbal tea and the Minister at the time abandoned it
The Minister can do the same
This goes against what the Minister of State's Government is trying to do about promoting good health
Currently, if I buy fast food, the VAT on the fast food is 13
However, if I want to buy a bottle of cod liver oil after 1 March, if the Minister of State gets his way there will be 23% VAT on it
That does not make sense
The Minister can gauge opinion in this House, but sometimes it is a bubble
However, a petition on this matter online has been signed by 25,000 people
It is asking that a stop be put on the proposed VAT hike
I am sure that figure will grow over time
The Minister has four weeks to think about it
He can use his discretion - it has been done before - because this measure does not make any sense
It will have a disproportionate effect on millions of people who use vitamins
I ask him to take guidance from our comments and review this decision

I congratulate Senator Black on introducing this historic Bill to the national Parliament of Ireland
It is a great Bill, although the economic impact it would have on the state of Israel would be limited
It is highly significant for the rest of the world and, of course, the Palestinian people
The world is watching and we hope the contagion of boycotting the state of Israel is just beginning
People Before Profit would like to go further and have a complete boycott of all Israeli goods entering the European Union, including Ireland, and see the expulsion of the Israeli ambassador from this country
The House has a moral obligation to pass the Bill
The Minister's statements are complete drivel, an issue to which I will return
We need to send a signal to apartheid Israel that its policy of murder and occupation can no longer go unhindered under international law
There have to be economic consequences
We can hide behind the legal jargon and protocols of the Dáil, while the European Union cries crocodile tears on a consistent basis, but the trade in goods between Israel and the Union is worth €35 billion
On a daily basis, ordinary Palestinians are murdered and imprisoned for no reason
Therefore, it is a matter of taking sides
It is a matter of being on the side of the occupied rather than the occupier, the side of the Palestinian rather than the illegal settler and the side of justice, not injustice
There is a precedent
In 1987 in this House Ireland became one of the first countries in the world to ban the importation of fruit from apartheid South Africa
That sent a signal across the world that a small country had stood up for justice and against the atrocities of apartheid
Nobody in his or her right mind, regardless of political persuasion, would try to defend apartheid South Africa
In 1990 Nelson Mandela came to this country to receive the freedom of Dublin
On the Dunnes Stores strike from 1984 to 1987, he said "ordinary people, far away from the crucible of apartheid, cared for our freedom
" He said the strike had kept him going through the darkest days of his imprisonment
That is what this Bill is about
Thousands of people have been killed in the past four or five years by the Israeli forces, but the Bill is giving the Palestinians hope in the darkness of occupation
We must pass it and not hide behind the bureaucracy and jargon of EU law
Public opinion favours the majority in this House
The Minister is on the wrong side of history and public opinion in Ireland
I am taking this question on behalf of Deputy Bríd Smith
Will the Minister of State provide the details of the planned increase in defence spending for 2019 in all areas? Will he also provide the details of the increase planned to deal with issues of pay and work conditions of Defence Forces members?
It is not an exaggeration to say that there is a major crisis in our Defence Forces with regard to pay, retention and conditions
There is also a crisis of low morale and non-recognition of army personnel regarding PDFORRA
Large numbers of members of the Defence Forces are leaving
Many of my constituents in Dublin Mid-West are in the Defence Forces
I know from them that force morale is extremely low
It was incredible that in September 2018, many Deputies joined members of the Defence Forces in a protest about pay and conditions
It is indicative that serving and retired members of the Defence Forces have to protest against the Department
PDFORRA has also had to bring the Department to court with regard to basic pay and the working time Act
It is indicative of what the Department is doing to the Defence Forces
That is not the reality facing those in the Defence Forces
They will tell Members that is not the case
If 20% of Defence Forces' members are applying for working family payment, there is something seriously wrong
This is mirrored across the public service
Some of the statistics are quite incredible
On average, Defence Forces personnel are working 64 hours per week
That is unsustainable both mentally and physically, yet army personnel are meant to work these hours for a low wage
This issue will not go away
It has to be addressed through pay and conditions and also by recognising the union, PDFORRA, which represents rank and file
Army personnel need to be recognised as a union because they are just as important as any worker in society
I am taking this question on behalf of Deputy Bríd Smith
Will the Minister of State provide the details of the planned increase in defence spending for 2019 in all areas? Will he also provide the details of the increase planned to deal with issues of pay and work conditions of Defence Forces members?
It is not an exaggeration to say that there is a major crisis in our Defence Forces with regard to pay, retention and conditions
There is also a crisis of low morale and non-recognition of army personnel regarding PDFORRA
Large numbers of members of the Defence Forces are leaving
Many of my constituents in Dublin Mid-West are in the Defence Forces
I know from them that force morale is extremely low
It was incredible that in September 2018, many Deputies joined members of the Defence Forces in a protest about pay and conditions
It is indicative that serving and retired members of the Defence Forces have to protest against the Department
PDFORRA has also had to bring the Department to court with regard to basic pay and the working time Act
It is indicative of what the Department is doing to the Defence Forces
That is not the reality facing those in the Defence Forces
They will tell Members that is not the case
If 20% of Defence Forces' members are applying for working family payment, there is something seriously wrong
This is mirrored across the public service
Some of the statistics are quite incredible
On average, Defence Forces personnel are working 64 hours per week
That is unsustainable both mentally and physically, yet army personnel are meant to work these hours for a low wage
This issue will not go away
It has to be addressed through pay and conditions and also by recognising the union, PDFORRA, which represents rank and file
Army personnel need to be recognised as a union because they are just as important as any worker in society
Deputy Paul Murphy's Bill is timely and relevant
I first ran in the local elections in 2004
I distinctly remember being aghast when Michael McDowell first floated the idea of a referendum on citizenship
It was bogus then and it is bogus now
The effects of the referendum are felt across the country
It is absolutely absurd that a child who has gone to school here and been cared for here can be deported
I am almost embarrassed to be a citizen of a country that would try to deport a child in such a way
Somebody who is born here has a right to stay here and live here and be a citizen here
I am proud to be a citizen of the country when communities stand up and show solidarity for children or others who will be deported from the country
It makes me very proud to be from this country
The communities of people like Eric and Nonso stood shoulder to shoulder with them, which was a brilliant show of solidarity
I will concentrate on something that has probably not been said here tonight
There is a stark contrast apparent in the issue of citizenship
It concerns the ability to buy citizenship
There are millionaires who have bought citizenship and passports
They have never lived in the country, not even for a day, yet they can buy a passport and citizenship
I find it ludicrous and absurd that as a result of wealth and to avoid tax such people can get citizenship
That scheme is continued by the Government
That situation is in stark contrast to sending a person to a country he or she has never been to
There is significant contrast between them and us, the rich and poor
I will refer to the rise of racism across the world, how we tackle it and what we should do to prevent it
There are some elements in the country and some among elected representatives who try to whip up racism and bigotry for their own needs
It should be combated in every sphere of life, whether in here or in the community
We stand shoulder to shoulder with anybody who will be deported as a result of the ludicrous legislation introduced in 2004
We want it repealed immediately so people will not face deportation or exile in future
It is true
I will send something to the Minister later which proves it
I am slightly disappointed that the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, is not here to answer the questions I have been trying to raise in the Dáil for at least a year
Two years ago the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, produced a report entitled Cannabis for Medical Use - A Scientific Review
I argue that the review was fast-tracked due to Vera Twomey's fight for access to medicinal cannabis for her daughter
In the two years since the report's publication nothing has been done
We were critical of the report because of its limitations, its conservatism and its stipulation that medicinal cannabis should only be used in the treatment of three conditions
Incredibly a major omission from the report related to chronic pain
The greatest efficacy for medicinal cannabis is for chronic pain
The report was published two years ago and we still have no cannabis, no access and no programme
Parents and patients are forced to go abroad and forced to break the law which is completely unsustainable
Parents have run out of options
They have tried everything clinically, but they have to leave the jurisdiction to obtain this medication
The Government has failed them
The Minister for Health has come out with the mantra that it is a supply issue, but it is not a supply issue
I do not find that a credible response
This comes from institutionalised resistance by the HSE, the Department of Health, the HPRA, the Government and some in the medical profession
After waiting for two years, the people want meaningful progress on the issue
Just before Christmas, Thailand, which has one of the most extreme anti-drug laws, passed legislation on the legalisation of medicinal cannabis
It has also happened in Mexico and other countries
Six months ago Britain had no policy on the matter and the Tory Government has changed even though it is extremely restrictive
In this country we have issued 13 licences to 13 individuals over two years
I have been extremely critical of that licensing system
It is extremely bureaucratic and cumbersome
Most of the time people going to their doctor or specialist have a negative experience
The specialists claim they do not have enough information about it and so forth
That licensing system is not workable
If the patient is granted a licence, there is no guarantee that they will be reimbursed and in addition they have to go abroad to get the medication
Therefore we are sending the patient to, in particular, the Netherlands to get the medication and bring it back
The medical profession, the public and the vast majority of Deputies will say that is not sustainable
I keep going on about this issue because of the injustice of normal parents seeking the best for their children having to go abroad and break the law which is unacceptable
I do not know who writes this rubbish but this answer is exactly the same as all previous answers I have received
The HPRA report was published two years ago but there is still no access programme
People are having to go abroad, break the law or use the ministerial licence system
The Minister of State made reference to the clinical guidelines which hold that the access programme will not recommend cannabis based products with THC for refractory epilepsy
There are 13 licencees at the moment, nine of whom have epilepsy
These patients are being prescribed cannabis with THC by specialist doctors
What will happen to them when and if the access programme is up and running? Will they stay in the ministerial licence system? Will they still have to go abroad and will they continue to have fears around reimbursement? This is an absolute mess
There are hundreds, if not thousands of people who could benefit from medical cannabis but this Government is denying them access because of bureaucracy
This is a question of institutionalised resistance from top to bottom
I do not find it credible that the Department cannot find a supplier of medical cannabis for Irish patients
That is just not credible
Why was this issue not flagged a year and a half ago by the HPRA, the Department or the Minister? There is serious institutional resistance to this
The Government may have time on its hands but thousands of patients do not
They are suffering because of bureaucracy
I do not know how members of the Government can live with themselves
If it is not possible to get the access programme up and running, the Government should revert to the Bill that I put before the House over two years ago and which garnered the support of the majority of Members of this Dáil
The Government has stalled the progress of that legislation
It is the same

I will speak as a cyclist rather than as a Deputy
I am an avid cyclist and cycle to Leinster House every day from Clondalkin
I have cycled all my life and have never had a car
As I cycle everywhere, I know what the people in the Visitors Gallery think
Deputy Troy's motion is a good one and largely there is nothing with which to disagree
I am trying to be as positive as possible on the subject
There are very welcome things in the Minister's statement about BusConnects and the extra 200 km of cycle tracks
There are positive things for cyclists, but everything is not perfect by any means
It is quite dangerous to be a cyclist
Cyclists need to be kept safe by taking them off the main arteries
It is safe to say there has been a renaissance of cycling under way in Ireland in the past eight or nine years because of the bike to work scheme
In the 1980s everybody cycled because of Stephen Roche and Sean Kelly and there was an explosion of cycling
There are still about 12% of people who cycle to work every day, which is good
If the Minister builds the infrastructure required, people will use it
For example, the Grand Canal and the Royal Canal are the best possible greenways
They run from the city centre to the River Shannon and 95% of the routes are off the main road
We should utilise them more
The new greenway running from Mulranny to Achill and the one in County Waterford are fantastic
The Waterford greenway runs from Waterford to Dungarvan and is incredible
I urge everybody to cycle some part, if not all, of it as it is a fantastic amenity
Cycling is egalitarian
Everybody can cycle without having to cycle the entire length of a greenway
It is a great activity for families and tourists
Cycle tourism will be enormous in Europe and across the world
Ireland could become a Mecca for such tourism if we can gear our infrastructure towards the provision of more greenways and cycle-friendly options for commuters and tourists
There are many secondary and tertiary roads which are not safe but which are often used by cyclists
There is a lot of potential, but the main issue is safety
Last year was an I welcome this debate about cycling
I do not want to be political about it but as legislators we can play a part in making it as safe as possible for cyclists across the country
I welcome the opportunity to contribute on orphan drugs
There debate on the issue has been ongoing since I was elected to the Dáil in February 2016
The Bill will go some way to providing equity for those who live with rare conditions in Ireland
The campaign by those affected by cystic fibrosis for access to Orkambi probably brought this issue to the fore
Since then, parents and families of those with rare diseases have had to consistently protest and highlight their situation
I refer to Kuvan and Spinraza
Kuvan is used in the treatment of phenylketonuria, PKU
It is readily available in mainland Europe but, bizarrely, is not available to those who have PKU in Ireland
Ironically, the drug is made in Ireland, as are many orphan drugs that are not available to Irish citizens
It is incredible that parents are forced to fundraise, beg or go public to get access to these drugs
Some pharmaceutical companies get large grants from the IDA and benefit from low levels of corporation tax
Big pharma has governments and patients over a barrel
The companies make vast profits
Pharmaceutical companies across the world have grown exponentially in the past 15 or 20 years because there are significant money and profits to be made from drugs
It is probably no exaggeration to state that the public perceives the current evaluation of orphan drugs process to be unfair
I read the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health report on evaluating orphan drugs published in February of this year and it is a really good document
Some of the documents published in the Oireachtas probably never see the light of day
I encourage Members to read this one, however
It is a really good piece of work
Some of the recommendations are bang on the money
They include changing the evaluation process, more patient participation and a review of the 2013 Act, which is what we are speaking about today
Also included are recommendations on reimbursement and pricing and compassionate use
It is recommended that the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics QALY processes be revised and replaced
This is at the heart of the debate
It is the committee's view that unless the State has some involvement in the research and development element of orphan drugs, we will constantly be on the back foot with regard to funding
This is really important work by the joint committee
The committee recommended that the State have a role in drugs manufacturing, research and so forth
This is about life and death
Nobody has a monopoly on compassion, regardless of what side of the House one is on
Everybody wants to see the best done for those we engage with, who need this medicine
It is absurd to force families to campaign to get medication
When their lives are at risk, they cannot get it because it comes down to money
To me and most people, that is absurd
Medicine has made astronomical strides for humankind but when it comes to profit it has made strides backwards
It is absurd in this day and age that one cannot gain access to medicine
Therefore, we welcome this Bill
Yesterday, Noreen O'Neill returned from Barcelona having filled a prescription for medical cannabis for her son Michael but the medication was taken from her by customs officials in Dublin Airport
Unfortunately, Noreen is not the first and will not be the last parent to go through this
On a weekly basis, parents are travelling to other jurisdictions in order to access healthcare for their children
This situation is completely untenable and shambolic
Two years have passed but the Government has still not acted on the cannabis access programme recommended by the Health Products Regulatory Authority
The Government has failed to act on an issue affecting so many families who have to travel abroad to obtain health care for their children and who are breaking the law in doing so
It is totally unacceptable
There are hundreds of families-----
I am sharing time with Deputy Coppinger
It was very revealing how, in the debate and at Leader's Questions earlier, the conflict of interest facing landlords in the Dáil exercised the establishment parties so much
Why is that? It is because it exposes not only the naked personal interest, but the class interest, which lies behind the Government's policies on the housing crisis, which are supported by Fianna Fáil
The answers of those who say it is ridiculous that we would call on landlord Deputies not to vote on this Bill are extremely revealing
They say it is the same as us voting on taxation as we are taxpayers
The defence behind which they hide is section 5(ii) of the code of conduct for Members of Dáil Éireann other than office holders
It states, "A conflict of interest does not exist where the Member or other person benefits only as a member of the general public or a broad class of persons
" Therefore, the defence of those who say there is no conflict of interest which would exclude them from voting is that they are part of a broad class of persons, that is the landlord class
We agree
They are part of the landlord class
They represent the landlord class
Even those among the establishment parties who do not own properties represent the landlord class through the policies they pursue and the neoliberal ideology they defend
It was exposed extremely well in the statement by the Minister, Deputy Murphy, earlier when he spoke about not interfering too much
He did not say exactly in what we were not meant to interfere too much but it was clear he was talking about not interfering with the capitalist market, the free market which allows wealth to flood upwards to the landlords, the bosses and the bankers rather than trickling down to ordinary people, as it is supposedly meant to
This free market has allowed rents in the property market to increase by 30% since this Government came to power and has allowed the amount of wealth going to landlords in this country annually to double in the past six or seven years
This was added to a new idea, which I believe is also something to do with the free market
This is the idea that we are a young rental market and that we would like to be a mature rental market in which we can have all of these kinds of decent tenancy protections and rights but that we are on a journey to that mature rental sector, which will take a while, and that we cannot pre-empt it with any legislation which would give tenants significant rights
The Minister of State should tell the children living in 539 North Circular Road about the journey to a mature rental sector
He has a choice tomorrow to defend those children and to defend others facing eviction or to allow the market, the landlords and big corporate landlords in particular to continue to ride roughshod over their rights
I have a termination notice here which sums up just how bad the crisis has got
It is a termination notice for 21 December, four days before Christmas, addressed to some people who are currently in transitional housing from homelessness in Tallaght Cross
Their 18 months of transitional housing is up and they are not able to find alternative accommodation
They have therefore formally been given notice to quit
It is a sign of how horrific the crisis is when homeless people are being evicted or threatened with eviction back into homelessness
The Minister has said that the notice will not be carried out and that they will not be evicted, but they are awaiting written confirmation from Túath and from the Government that this is the case and that they will not be evicted
They are organised and are prepared to resist any attempt at eviction
I met a number of them on Monday
That is exactly what we need
We have to face the reality
There is no convincing the Government
One quarter of its members are landlords and they all represent the landlord class
They are not going to pass legislation which significantly interferes with landlords' right to profit
The only conclusion, therefore, is that we need a movement
The Minister of State can see what is happening with the yellow vest protest in France, a revolt from below of the oppressed against the president of the rich, Macron, forcing him back and forcing concessions, some of them which have been given but which are inadequate and which are rightly seen by people as being crumbs
The movement continues and has the potential to force him out of office
We need a movement like the yellow vests here on the issue of housing, with young people and students to the fore
We have raised the idea of a national students' strike, occupations of campuses, and raising the struggle nationally on a higher plain
There is also the question of regional and national demonstrations in the new year and, crucially, the role of the trade unions and ICTU in putting their full weight behind those demonstrations, not only in mobilising people but in building for industrial action, perhaps starting with the idea of lunchtime action or half-day action and moving to a one-day general strike on the issue of housing to show the Government the power of working class people who want action on the housing crisis
Two years
It is not an issue with the supplier
It is not misinformation
The Taoiseach is a disgrace
The Taoiseach is a disgrace
The Taoiseach is a disgrace
The Taoiseach is a disgrace
The Taoiseach is a disgrace
That is the lowest thing I have seen here
The Government has had two years to get this right and has done nothing
Thousands of people are suffering
The Government is a joke
The Taoiseach is a disgrace
I want him to withdraw that remark
I want the Taoiseach to withdraw that remark
The Taoiseach is making accusations with that poster
The Taoiseach should do what he was about to do
I want the Taoiseach to withdraw that remark
The Taoiseach is implying in the poster-----
Why did he introduce the poster? That was a year and a half ago
It has nothing to do with us
I welcome the debate and commend Deputy Butler on her consistency in dealing with the issue of dementia
I have vast experience of dealing with the issue
Working with elderly people with dementia for three years as a care assistant in Cherry Orchard Hospital gave me probably the best life experience I have had in my life
I refer not only to the elderly people there but also the staff and relatives who had to deal with this issue
It is testimony to the staff who work in health services
They show such dedication in these extremely difficult circumstances
The debate we are having is welcome
Elderly people have suffered immensely because of austerity cuts and increasing poverty levels in the last decade
A report in the To deal with the present we must deal with the past
In 2008, in response to Fianna Fail's attempt to bring forward changes to the medical card scheme for the over-70s, more than 15,000 older people mobilised to force an embarrassing climbdown by the then Fianna Fáil Government
In another blow to elderly people Fianna Fáil intended to reduce the State pension in 2011, but huge pressure from elderly groups made it back down
However, it managed to make significant cuts to carer's benefit, carer's allowance, disability allowance, widow's, widower's and surviving civil partner's contributory pension and death benefit, all of which hugely affected the elderly
These are not abstract actions but decisions that greatly affected older people's lives and well-being
Let us not forget the former Minister for Health and Children, Mary Harney, who in coalition with Fianna Fáil introduced the fair deal nursing home support scheme in 2009
Instead of providing public care for the elderly, the scheme introduced a co-payments system under which the cost of care was shared between the State and patients, making people pay for services to which previously they had been entitled under the guise of so-called "fairness"
By 2011 the funding allocation for the scheme had run out, leaving elderly people waiting in hospitals instead of nursing homes
It was an abject failure caused by the very bad decision to privatise elderly care services
I also note that the Minister of State, Deputy English, made a statement in the I am curious as to how the obsession with privatisation and the market is going to solve the housing crisis or provide care for the elderly
We can see the damage this agenda has caused and is causing and what it will do in the future
I hope this is only the beginning of improvements to care services for the elderly, as weak mitigations will not be enough to provide care on an equal basis for all
I welcome this discussion in respect of the proposed Dublin north inner city development authority
Dublin's inner city has been marginalised by inequality and the consequences of drug addiction
It should not be defined by those things because it is a very decent community to live and work in
What has happened there is the result of Government policies over the decades
Most people are in favour of regeneration but what kind of regeneration are we seeking? Regeneration of areas has not always been good
In some cases, it has been quite bad
For example, the Dublin docklands have been completely gentrified
People whose families have lived there for generations cannot afford to rent or buy apartments or houses in the area
This is happening not only in Dublin but also in other communities across Europe
People whose families have lived in areas for generations have been pushed out by high finance in order to make way for gentrification through the building of apartment and office blocks
That is not what regeneration is about
If regeneration is about a social dividend for the people who live in an area, then those responsible for the regeneration of the docklands got it dramatically wrong
Urban renewal schemes enjoyed success in the context of specific areas being physically regenerated but evidence shows that they fail dramatically to address the socioeconomic difficulties of working class communities across the State
Any regeneration process must be community-led, not developer-led
I will refer again to the docklands where the regeneration was developer-led
There have been some good regenerations for aesthetic and livelihood reasons but in terms of poverty and inequality it has been quite a failure
The Bill proposes that there be three places on the authority for community representatives
This is an imbalance that has to be addressed
It is proposed that there will be 15 members on the proposed authority
If there are only three members to represent the community, there will be a major imbalance
There has to be a balance in terms of the people from the community the proposed authority is supposed to benefit being represented
That would be good
We must learn the lessons from the past and present that regeneration can be good but it can also be an extreme failure, as has panned out in the docklands
We welcome the discussion over the next couple of days
I welcome to the Gallery five parents from various parts of Ireland and Britain
They are Vera Twomey, Callie Blackwell, Tannine Montgomery, Danielle Davis and Karen Grey
Currently these parents are treating their children with medical cannabis
I missed Deputy Micheál Martin's contribution
The policy on medical cannabis from this Government is absolutely shambolic
One year ago to the day, a majority of the House voted to let the Bill for medical cannabis proceed to the next stage
The Government has basically put in place an embargo
Time is of the essence
Currently people have to leave the country to get access to medicinal cannabis via licence
It gets worse
Parents of children have to access medical cannabis illegally to treat the conditions
As long as there is ambiguity and a lack of legislative change we will have this chaotic situation
It has been two years since the Health Products Regulatory Authority report
It has been one year since our legislation
What is it going to be? Will it be our legislation or the HPRA report?
The House overturned that decision
Why has it taken two years?
People Before Profit supports the Bill and I commend Deputy Ellis on his work on the issue
It is unfortunate the Government is not supporting it because it is a good amendment
The majority of motocross participants are very responsible
There is a minority who are irresponsible and that is played out in housing estates where I live where young people mainly are using them recklessly without helmets, going though parks and estates
That has led to deaths and serious injuries not only for those taking part but for also members of the public and other car users
Obviously it is a nuisance to the public
Some young people are looking for the adrenaline rush of being chased by the Garda and going 70 km/h or 80 km/h along a road
How can we turn that into a more positive thing? I make some comparisons
We had, and still have, in many housing estates the problem of roaming horses
There was legislative change in 1996, accompanied by a task force approach to trying to educate people about horses and so forth
As a result of Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine regulation it has largely worked
Regulation alone will not work
I welcome the task force approach to the issue
At local meetings attended by Deputy Bríd Smith, me and others, this issue constantly comes up
I wish to consider practical solutions and not just regulations
There are many motocross tracks in Dublin and other parts of the country, more than most people might think
Fingal County Council gave Mulhuddart Motocross Club 15 acres of land
Club members say that there had been a problem with people using vehicles recklessly
However, since the advent of the motocross club, incidents have reduced by 60% to 70%
It is not a panacea by any means, but certainly it is an issue that I hope the task force will take on board
If people have a controlled safe environment to use these motocross bikes, not only are they using them professionally, they find out how they work mechanically which helps with health and safety
There is another track in East Wall and a very good one in County Offaly
I know some of the members there
Most people who use these vehicles use them extremely responsibly and professionally
It is a sport after all
One of the oldest institutions in Ireland is the Motor Cycle Union of Ireland, which is 112 years old
It has been advocating on behalf of motorcycling throughout Ireland
I make a point about parents buying vehicles for their children
I have come across parents buying small mopeds for children as young as seven or eight
I do not know what the parents are thinking because this is a lethal vehicle that can go up to 70 km/h or 80 km/h
Any human being who comes off at that speed, regardless of whether they are wearing a helmet, will sustain serious injury
There are many nuances to this
I know some people who are irresponsible with motor vehicles like this
It is possible to bring them in and say that this is irresponsible and that they are going to kill themselves or kill somebody else
If they want to use that approach, it should be accompanied by having a track or an environment where it is safe for them
That will go some way towards addressing the bigger issue
I raise the issue of medical cannabis, which I have raised more times than any other issue in the two and a half years since my election
I just received a telephone call from a parent who is utterly confused about the position on medical cannabis
Three options are available, namely, to go through the licensing system for medical cannabis, to go abroad to obtain medical cannabis, or to obtain it illegally, as most people are doing
In January 2017, the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, made a recommendation on establishing a medical cannabis access programme
That was 19 months ago, and nothing has been done
Will the Tánaiste give a timeframe for having the access programme up and running? I ask him not to give another stock answer because I get the same old answers all the time
In the programme for Government under the area of mental health, the Government commits to building further capacity in child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS
In reality, since that document was produced, CAMHS have seriously deteriorated
I will outline some of the awful statistics on CAMHS
There are 40% fewer clinical psychologist posts, 50% fewer social workers and just under 60% fewer occupational therapists
At the same time, 50% of the country is still not covered by out-of-hours CAMHS
That is having a seriously detrimental effect on children and their parents
At 2 p
on Saturday in the Garden of Remembrance, the Still Waiting campaign will highlight the awful situation of waiting times in our health service
Will the Taoiseach address the position on CAMHS in particular?
People have run out of adjectives to describe the housing crisis
There is a simple reason for it
It comes down to ideology and the Government's neoliberal policy for the past seven and a half years
I want to address some of the terminology Ministers have been using which I find quite offensive
Using terms such as "ghettoisation" and "free homes" is insulting to anybody who has ever lived in a council house and I call on the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government to withdraw them
The Government goes on about the mistakes of the past
However, the provision of social housing has been a social success; the Government's housing policy has been a social disaster
Social apartheid is ongoing
One of the best examples of the crisis is in Clondalkin
A publicly owned 70-acre site is to be sold to a developer on Monday owing to a policy of the Government and the local authority
I say to our colleagues in the Labour Party and Fianna Fáil that there is an onus on their councillors to vote against this deal
At the height of the worst crisis in our generation we are selling public land to a developer
We cannot do so; the land needs to stay in public ownership
Today has been fantastic and it is just the start of a bigger movement across the country, but I do not believe the Government is capable of changing the situation
It is bedded down by ideology which is impossible to change
The only way to get rid of the Government is by holding a general election, for which the people are crying out because the longer Fine Gael is in government the more social damage it will do
People Before Profit will support this legislation, which is in response to last May’s Court of Appeal ruling that found part of the Mental Health Act 2001 unconstitutional
It is unconstitutional because it allows detention of an involuntary patient to be extended for up to 12 months without an effective or independent review within a reasonable timeframe
During this debate on this Bill, will the Minister of State clarify that the right of an individual to request a second tribunal under a six-month renewal order will not impinge on his or her right to an automatic tribunal within 21 days? If the Minister of State cannot reply now, perhaps someone could clarify this at a later stage
I would like to take this opportunity to raise the urgent need to update in full the Mental Health Act 2001
Successive Governments have consistently neglected to do this and this Government is no different
The Minister of State has given no indication of the date by which the draft Bill for the new mental health Act will be made available
The Minister of State, Deputy Daly, has stated that the Bill will be “significantly progressed” by the end of this year
Mental health organisations and groups have waited more than three years to see a draft Bill and there is still no definitive date for its publication
Mental health services across the board continue to struggle hugely within existing resources
Massive underfunding has led to a chaotic system that is failing so many adults and children with mental health difficulties
Many Deputies have brought this forward
Front-line staff regularly highlight the stress they experience while trying to do their jobs in the most trying of circumstances
Recruitment and retention of staff remains one of the biggest challenges in our health service
I have stated the following figures many times, but I believe it is worth repeating them because the statistics are quite shocking
Currently in child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, there is less than 40% of the required number of clinical psychologists in post, less than 50% of social workers and less than 60% of occupational therapists
Shockingly, 57
6% of Ireland is still not covered by out-of-hours CAMHS services
This means that children or young people experiencing a mental health crisis regularly have little option but to go to overstretched accident and emergency departments
This cannot be allowed to continue
People Before Profit will include a substantial investment in mental health services in our budget submission for 2019
This would bring us into line with figures contained in A Vision for Change and would represent an 8% spend of the total healthcare budget
We should be moving towards 12% of the overall health budget, which would bring us closer to Britain's current spending on mental health services
While I emphasise that this is an important amendment, there are other areas of legislation that also need to be urgently addressed, including the regulation ofcommunity residences for people with mental health difficulties, ensuring that 16 and 17 year olds have legal rights to consent to admission or mental health treatment, which will be the subject of future debate and worth listening to, and that voluntary patients have rights to information and advocacy
People Before Profit will support the Bill
Anything that gives patients more freedom and more rights to decisions about their health and well-being is very progressive
This Bill provides for the transfer of the land, property, rights and liabilities of the three children's hospitals to the proposed body
It is a very technical Bill, which gives continuity to the incumbent Children's hospital group board
I have reviewed the board membership of the national paediatric hospital development board and the Children's hospital group board
As mentioned by the previous speaker, there are not many union representatives, worker representatives or lay people on those boards, which is an astonishing omission in terms of membership of these boards
I hope that this new board will take cognisance of lay people, union representatives and worker representatives who work in the hospital
The hospital location in the form of the St
James's Hospital site is fantastic and it has been the subject of discussion for a very long time
I refer to the juxtaposition of the glitter of the new hospital and the manner in which we are treating children in today's Ireland
Like many other Deputies, I have engaged with parents on access to child and adolescent mental health, CAMHS, services and other services
The lack of services is beyond belief
Parents are so stressed and put to the pin of their collar that this is having an affect on both their daily lives and those of their children
These are determined parents who want the best for their children
They have organised into a new group called Enough is Enough, where every voice counts
The Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, will be aware of the crisis surrounding assessments of need
Owing to the suspension of the proposed new standard operating procedure, the system is in a mess
I am sure the Minister of State will agree that without diagnosis, children and their parents remain in very difficult situations
The current waiting time for an assessment of need is up to two years, which is unacceptable
Some parents have resorted to paying privately for speech and language services for their children, at a cost of approximately €120 to €140 per week
The Minister of State will, I believe, understand the point I am trying to make
On the one hand we are building a new hospital and new boards are being established and provided with statutory powers while at the same time thousands of children are waiting for elementary services, which are so important to their development, but they are not able to access them
The point I am making is that what is going on in terms of hospital building is in contradiction with what is happening in children's services
As a member of the Joint Committee on the Future of Mental Health Care, I am aware of the ongoing crisis in our system in terms of staff and so on
I support the Bill
It is important it be progressed quickly, given construction of the new children's hospital was first mooted in 2007
There is a big demonstration called by Enough is Enough on 6 October at 2 p
in the Garden of Remembrance for our parents and children who are awaiting vital services
It is important that people who are extremely frustrated by waiting times for their children come to this protest
In the programme for Government, there is a commitment to a health-led approach to the process of decriminalisation of personal drug use
There was an extraordinary number of submissions to the Department of Health over the summer as part of its public consultation process
This debate has been ongoing for many years
Most people here agree that harm reduction is the way forward to stop people going through the criminal justice system
When does the Taoiseach envisage this policy being realised? It has been suggested for many years and the vast majority of people in this country want to see a system that is health-led rather than one which throws people into jail
I have raised this issue numerous times in the two and half years since I was elected to the House
I understand that over the summer the Minister for Health brought a memorandum to Cabinet on the medical cannabis access programme
Over the summer the Department of Health issued guidelines on the access programme, some of which are quite flawed
It has been going on for a long time and the situation has become ludicrous
A man called Kenny Tynan, a father of four from Roscommon, was granted a licence one month ago from the Department of Health which was signed by the Minister
Today he was sent an email by the medicines management programme to say it would not reimburse the licence
The licence system is unworkable
People are getting licences when they cannot afford them
On average, it costs tens of thousands to go to Holland four times a year to get the medication
The system is completely flawed
In Britain the Tory Government has changed its policy
It is very restrictive but people are at least gaining access to medical cannabis
It saves them going to the black market or going abroad
The situation is unworkable
The Taoiseach has to show leadership
This has been going on for years now
There has to be some sort of clarity either on the licence system, the medical cannabis access programme or the legislation I have put forward

I move amendment No
3:To delete all words after “Dáil Éireann” and substitute the following:"notes that:— public transport provides an essential service for all citizens and is central to combatting climate change and climate change policy;— investment and funding for all three Córas Iompair Éireann (CIÉ) companies was systematically reduced during the recession and the Public Service Obligation funding to Dublin Bus remains lower today than prior to the recession in 2008;— Dublin Bus fleet numbers remain lower than the numbers prior to the recession, from over 1,160 in 2008 to just 1,016 in 2018;— passenger numbers carried by Dublin Bus have now returned to pre-recession levels but they are now carried on a much reduced number of actual buses in the city;— journey times have increased for passengers as a result of the introduction of the Luas Cross City line, as well as from increased traffic volumes;— bus priority measures remain inadequate, with low levels of enforcement and a lack of continuous bus lanes on major routes into the city;— in comparison to other European cities, funding of bus services in Dublin remains well below the European norm;— numerous fare increases have left the city with an expensive bus service in part to compensate for the failure of this Government and past Governments to adequately invest in the network;— the National Transport Authority (NTA) was set up by a previous Fianna Fáil administration with a specific remit to introduce competition to the bus market;— the NTA has failed to address underfunding of public transport or increased journey times, or the lack of bus lane infrastructure, during its existence; and— the NTA has instead been preoccupied with schemes to introduce competition to both the city and country bus services which has only facilitated the growth of private forprofit companies to the detriment of the existing State companies, and speeded up a race to the bottom in wages and conditions in the industry;therefore condemns attempts by the NTA under the BusConnects plan to lay the blame for these failures solely on the existing network design;further condemns threats to remove existing services used by the public and especially deplores attempts to remove 10 per cent of existing direct services into the city; andagrees that–— measures in BusConnects that seek the withdrawal of any existing service should be stopped;— other measures contained in BusConnects, including the proposals for numerous orbital routes, bus priority measures, dedicated bus lanes, dedicated cycle lanes, and transferable tickets across public transport, should proceed immediately; and— all proposed changes to existing services should be done in consultation with the communities and areas affected
I concur with my follow Dublin Mid-West Deputies
This is a unique project that has been in operation for 25 years in the Clondalkin-Lucan area
I have first-hand knowledge of it
My niece attended the Carline project
She will not mind me saying this because I have said it to her already but she dropped out of school
She went to the Carline project, completed the leaving certificate this year and is now doing a full-time course
She says that if it had not been for the Carline project, she probably would have taken a different road education-wise
I can say that in respect of the many young people who use the facility
It is a great facility that prevents young people taking a different road from the one they should take
It is imperative that this project is properly funded
The Minister of State has given a positive response
It is safe to say that the building complex is relatively old
Staff at the centre have indicated it needs refurbishment, particularly for health and safety reasons
As Deputy Ó Broin noted, the amount of funding involved is small when one considers the services the centre has provided to young people who have availed of its programmes over the past 25 years
If it was not for this service, who knows where those young people would have ended up? The staff and founders of the project have guided young people in a different and safer direction for educational purposes and put them on the right road in their own lives and those of their families
I hope the centre will secure the funding it needs to be a viable project for the future

I am sharing time with Deputies Boyd Barrett and Coppinger
I want to address the positives first
There are some positives with BusConnects, particularly around the orbital routes, cycling infrastructure, dedicated bus lanes, transferable tickets and so forth
Dublin Bus was once referred to as the workhorse of public transport and it certainly is that
It is probably one of the few bus services, if not the only one, in the world where people say "thank you" to the driver when they are getting on and off
I hope it stays that way with BusConnects
BusConnects is quite confusing and convoluted
A person would need a degree to work out what is what and where to go
The main thing about public transport is that it is convenient
The NTA says 92% of people will have a direct bus route into the city centre
That leaves 8% of people without a direct bus route
I want to talk about that 8%, especially in Dublin Mid-West
Areas such as Newcastle and Rathcoole, which have growing populations, new housing and so forth, will lose their direct bus service into the city centre
This was mooted in 2010 under Network Direct by Dublin Bus, but the people of Newcastle and Rathcoole, through people power, won their direct bus into the city centre
It does not make sense for commuters in Rathcoole or Newcastle to lose a direct bus service into the city centre
It is proposed that the bus would stop at the Saggart or Red Cow Luas stop and people would switch to the Luas
That does not make sense
It would not save time
There are positive things with BusConnects but it is highly convoluted
There is a lot of opposition locally to people losing their bus service
I hope there will be consultation over the next 18 months and we will see what happens after that
In July the Department of Health produced guidelines for the medicinal cannabis access programme which was first mooted in January 2017, almost 20 months ago
No progress has been made since
The guidelines have been welcomed by patients and doctors and provide some clarity in what is an extremely confusing situation for those who wish to access medicinal cannabis
I ask the Taoiseach to show leadership and say when the medicinal cannabis access programme will be implemented
No progress has been made since it was proposed 20 months ago
If it cannot be implemented, the Government should look to the Cannabis for Medicinal Use Regulation Bill 2016 I put forward and which the majority of Members in this Dáil voted to progress in October last year
The Government must do one or the other
It must provide clarity for patients, doctors and others on whether the programme will be implemented
Will the Minister support the call for a new inquest into the deaths of 48 persons in the Stardust fire on 14 February 1981?
Every Member will acknowledge that after 37 years of pain, the relatives of those who died that night still have not had closure or justice
When one looks back to what happened in Hillsborough in 1989, nobody can run from justice
Only a few days ago, some of those policing the stadium that day had charges of manslaughter made against them
The Stardust families are looking for a new inquest into the deaths of their relatives
Antoinette Keegan, who lost two sisters in the fire that night, put a freedom of information request in for documentation and submissions to the McCartan report in November 2017
Almost eight months after this request, she still has not received those papers which would be crucial to a new inquest
Can the Minister comment on that?
There is enormous public support for a new inquest and to get to the truth of this matter
That manifested itself at the recent Leinster football final between Laois and Dublin when, on the 48th minute for the 48 victims, there was a round of applause in support for a new inquest
The relatives will say that the McCartan report was narrow in its remit
They have further information and submissions to another inquest
The families at least deserve a new inquest into the deaths of their brothers, sisters and loved ones on that night
After all, no justice was done to those who managed that facility in any way
The families are calling for a new inquest
That is what they deserve after 37 years of terrible pain

I wish to raise the issue of hate crime
The Irish Council for Civil Liberties today published its report on hate crime in Ireland
The report found that a policy vacuum exists for those people subjected to hate crimes, especially people from African backgrounds and transgender people
I am aware that this issue will be raised on Saturday at the transgender healthcare protest, which will be held at 3 p
It is a very serious issue and has been on the legislative books for a long time
I believe the last piece of legislation to deal with hate crime was in 1989
Perhaps the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, will comment on this
For God's sake
Deputy Mattie McGrath lost that argument
Deputy Mattie McGrath is a disgrace
This debate has been going on for years but, frustratingly, it seems to have stalled
There is much talk but no action
I am glad 14,000 submissions have been received so far in the public consultation on the law on possession of drugs for personal use
I look forward to the report being completed by October
Hopefully, the recommendations can consider some of the issues around personal drug use
I also want to commend the critical roles played by community drug projects and local drug task forces, which continue to deliver a fantastic service in their communities, even though their budgets have been cut by 37% over the past eight years
These cuts have led to dramatic changes in what they can give to their communities
I have seen this for myself in Clondalkin
The strategy of criminalising people for drug use has been an abject failure
There is a catchword that the war on drugs has been a failure
In fact, it has been an abject failure
It just does not work
It has failed communities and judicial systems
One must look at a radical approach to dealing with drug use and what that entails
Whether we like it, people will continue to use drugs
They used drugs generations ago and generations to come will continue to do so
Do we criminalise them? No, we should not
People found with drugs for personal use should not go through the criminal justice system because it has failed
In my community, I have seen the abuse of drugs ravage not only friends of mine but family members
I have seen whole communities destroyed
What it does to people’s mindsets acts like a cancer in communities
Words cannot articulate what drugs do and what they leave behind
Nobody is born a heroin addict but, sometimes, addiction chooses people
When heroin gets a hold of a person, it is a difficult drug from which to get away
Some people do and others do not
Friends of mine have passed away due to heroin addiction
I know others who got away from addiction and have done very well
They have children and good jobs
Sometimes, regardless of whether we like it, drugs take hold of people
In the debate on drugs, I have always heard that cannabis is a gateway to harder drugs
That is absolute rubbish
The gateway to heroin, crack and all the drugs which bring misery, is alienation and poverty
I accept people who have chronic heroin problems probably smoked hash
However, it just does not lead on to harder drugs
I know many people who smoke cannabis but will never touch heroin, crack, cocaine and so forth
We need a radical approach in this regard
Decriminalisation, as the previous Deputy said, decriminalises the person rather than the drugs
In 2001, Portugal decriminalised drugs for personal use
A person found with a particular drug on them for personal use will not go through the criminal justice system but will be given counselling, health-led products and assistance with harm reduction
Last year, 80% of drug-related offences in this State were for personal use, meaning 10,000 people have gone through the criminal justice system because of personal use of drugs
That is a complete waste of time for the criminal justice system and the police
The police at the front line in the war on drugs will admit that it is failing them and civil society and that we need a new approach
Decriminalisation is one approach to that
If people who are found in possession of drugs for personal use get a criminal record, this will have a profound effect on their future job prospects
I know people who were caught 15 years ago with a small amount of cannabis but still have a drug offence record
I remember going to a festival 15 years ago at which undercover police were looking for people with a small possession of cannabis and arresting them
It was ridiculous
Obviously, civic society has moved on and we cannot criminalise people for cannabis use in particular because it is a complete waste of time
Decriminalisation of drugs is inevitable
The Minister of State will have to look at the whole range of drugs contained in the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977
Classifying cannabis as a Schedule 1 drug having no medical or recreational use is ridiculous
For example, this year the Minister for Health granted a licence for medical cannabis that involved the raw form of cannabis
It meant the person was basically granted a licence for a bag of grass
That is a fact
While I am glad the Minister granted a licence to a person in the State for the medical use of cannabis, it is classified as a Schedule 1 drug
More controversially, all illicit drugs are controlled by criminal individuals or gangs who do extremely well out of selling drugs
They have big cars, holidays and so forth
The war on drugs has been a failure
Society must look at ways of taking drugs out of the hands of criminal gangs and individuals and to take them back
These gangs are unregulated and do not care what they sale
They sell to children, individuals die from using their drugs and communities are destroyed by them
We must look at the legalisation of some drugs
This is a nuanced argument which some people will find difficult
I also believe we will need to look at a more radical approach than decriminalisation
My starting point is whether this will save somebody's life
If it can, then it is worth approaching and looking at
At present, hundreds of people die of overdoses, use opiates or are affected by drugs
If we can cut that by half, by any means, and if we can save one life by decriminalisation, regulation and legalisation of some drugs, we can have a different approach to this issue
We are losing the war on drugs
It should not be a war
It is a war on people
I ask the Minister of State to comment on the points I have raised, particularly repeal of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977
The Health Products Regulatory Authority made a recommendation that this Government set up a cannabis access programme 18 months ago
Nothing has happened since
The Dáil supported the Bill I put forward eight months ago providing for access to medicinal cannabis
As nothing has happened, we will continue to have cases such as that of Noreen O'Neill
I welcome the news from the Tánaiste today that the Government has given extra funding to the UNRWA for Palestine Refugees in the Near East
I understand Ireland will give €250,000
I am raising the issue because UNRWA has stated that it is experiencing its worst funding crisis of the past 70 years
The agency was set up because of Israel's expulsion of Palestinian people from Palestine
Many Palestinian refugees are in the occupied West Bank, Gaza, Syria and Jordan
It is welcome that the Government has tried to address some of the shortfall
There is a shortfall because Donald Trump's Administration has withdrawn 80% of the funding
It is small beer compared to the funding the US gives Israel, but it will have profound effects on the many Palestinians in refugee camps
These people rely on the funding for schools and so on
The head of the agency says that if the funding is not met by other donors, people will suffer
It is probably in the interests of the Israeli Government that Palestinians suffer even more
This is about collective punishment by another means on the part of the American Administration, including Mr
Trump
He is probably the greatest Zionist of them all
I am unsure if the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach will attend the European Council but I hope he will raise the issue
One startling aspect of the crisis in Palestine is the UN reckons that in 2020, one and a half years from now, the Gaza Strip, where 1
2 million people live, will become unliveable
That will have profound effects for those people
As Deputies and citizens of this country, we have always had a pro-Palestinian view
We saw Palestinian people being driven out of their homes and discriminated against on a daily basis
The general tone of this State and of the people who live here is pro-Palestinian
It is welcome that the Government has granted a further €250,000
That brings our contribution up to €6 million to the fund
However, the crisis will continue
We have run out of adjectives to describe what Donald Trump is about
He is a maniac who will destroy many of the people who he believes are against his policy
Our solidarity is always with the Palestinian people
I welcome the new funding
I call on the Minister of State to raise the matter at the European Council during the week
I support the motion
It is a good motion and it is good to have this debate in the Dáil
Special needs assistants provide an invaluable service in our schools
They play a key role in our mainstream schools by helping children with special educational needs to learn with their peers in an inclusive way
While many parents and teachers appreciate the support and assistance that SNAs give to children to help them to navigate the mainstream school system, the Government consistently undervalues and under-appreciates the important role they play
Only last year, SNAs decided they had no option but to vote overwhelmingly for industrial action
This was borne out of immense frustration at what they saw as the Government's failure to listen to and address their mounting concerns
Will the Minister indicate whether there are any plans to review the supplementary assignment panel with a view to giving more rights to SNAs who are made redundant? That is an important question and I call on the Minister to address it in some format
I call on the Government to delay implementing the recommendation of the recent National Council for Special Education review until it consults with more than 9,000 SNAs who have union representation
Why did the NCSE fail to do this in the first place? It is important to consult with the union representing 9,000 SNAs
I urge the Government to consider allowing SNAs sit on school boards of management to help address the power imbalance
That would allow SNAs to have a say in matters relevant for them
SNAs play an integral part in schools and I believe they should have some sort of formal representation on boards of management, if possible
This is an important teaching and supervisory role in schools
SNAs should have a more democratic say in the schools where they work and teach
I have raised countless times in the Chamber the issue of lack of access to medical cannabis
Yesterday, I was in the House of Commons with Vera Twomey where we attended a presentation on access to medical cannabis in Britain
I will get onto that in a few minutes
In the time that I have
Ms Twomey spoke passionately about the ordeal her family went through
I spoke to MPs about the lack of progress and, in particular, about the Government stalling the legislation
I do not know if the Tánaiste has been watching, but the Tory Government in the UK has done a U-turn on access to medicinal cannabis and is carrying out a full review
The Minister for Health briefed the Cabinet two or three weeks ago about the lack of access to medical cannabis
I want the Tánaiste to give me an answer on the lack of access to medical cannabis while people are suffering
I know for a fact that people will die because of the Government's lack of progress on this issue
They are going to die
Can the Tánaiste withdraw that remark? That is not true
He said piece of legislation
The Government has sat on that Bill for the last eight months
It is a lie
The Tánaiste has misled the House
He misled the House
It should not be up to the Minister
If the Tánaiste starts to give straight answers, I will stop
This housing crisis originated over a decade ago, springing from a particular ideology
That ideology said that the State would build no more houses and it would be left up to the free market
That is why we have a homelessness crisis and a housing crisis today in which nearly 10,000 people are homeless
That can seem abstract to people in this House but it is not abstract to me or to most of my comrades here
People are living in hotels and bed and breakfasts and sometimes in cars, tents and streets
It is completely unacceptable
I will mention the C-word, which is "class"
There is a deep class prejudice in the Government when it comes to housing
The narrative is that social housing equates to ghettoisation, bad people and anti-social behaviour
I reject that and, as a person who comes from a council estate, find it insulting
There are some amazing people who have lived in council houses
The majority of social housing has been a huge success in this country
Of course there are instances where it has failed but it has largely been successful
Under this Government and under Fianna Fáil, social housing has become a dirty word
That is why we have a terrible situation in this country
I want to make it less abstract and I want the Minister of State to comment on this point, which really gets at the heart of the problem
There is a site in Clondalkin called Kilcarbery Grange
It is a site of 71 acres and it is being sold off to private developers
This land could provide as many as 900 social and affordable homes
It is owned by the State, which is selling it off to developers
The council will then buy back 30% of the houses from the developers
Basically, the council will sell the land, the developer will build the houses and then the developer will sell that 30% back to the council
How does that make sense? The council will have to buy 30%, approximately 290 houses, at market rate
Can anybody make sense of this? I do not know how this makes sense
What the Government is doing, as have successive Governments, is to sell public land off to developers at the height of the worst crisis in the State
That is absolutely unforgivable
It comes down to political choice and political ideology
Some people do not like using the word "class"
I actually like using it
It defines the situation we have in this country, where people are discriminated against on a class basis
If these were 10,000 people from a different class bracket, this would not be the case
The Minister of State knows that, as do I and as does everyone in this House
If this affected 10,000 people from Foxrock, there would not be 10,000 people on the streets or homeless
That is a fact
Can the Minister of State comment on it?
This is happening across the State
I want to address what the Minister said earlier about withdrawing the remark about the GSOC report
I will not be withdrawing any remark
I will reiterate what I said earlier
It was a complete whitewash
I would like the Minister to withdraw his remark that I was jumping on some bandwagon because this report was a whitewash
It was an insult to the O'Farrell family
Shane would be still here now if it were not for the failings of the police and the State
Shane should be living his life but on the night of 2 August 2011, everything changed because this was an accident waiting to happen
There was a systemic failure on the part of the powers that are supposed to protect every citizen in this county - the police, the legal system and the State
They failed not only Shane but the O'Farrell family
What the O'Farrell family are looking for is very simple
They cannot bring Shane back but they can get justice and truth
That is the simple narrative of what the family is looking for today
I watched the documentary last night on the terrible Grenfell Tower fire that claimed so many lives in London
The narrative of that documentary was that the fire was completely preventable and the relatives of those who died want justice
In terms of all the tragedies that happened in Britain and Ireland, the families and the public want justice
That is what the O'Farrell family are looking for today
Many comments were made in this Chamber tonight and also in the debate ten days ago
Again, the family are asking for a public inquiry
The GSOC report was empty of anything substantial
It took six years to come up with that report
That is an insult to anybody's intelligence
It is an insult to the family that after six years, GSOC could not come up with something such as a criminal investigation against certain members of the police in Cavan and Monaghan
There is no doubt that Shane O'Farrell would be alive today if it were not for the litany of complete failures by the police force
On that matter and in Shane's memory, the family deserve truth, justice and a public inquiry
That should be the case not only for that family but for every citizen in this country
If the Minister does not provide for that, it will be a stain on his time here as Minister for Justice and Equality
I ask him to give the family a public inquiry
I welcome Lucia and all her family who are in the Gallery
Today we should not be taking about Shane O'Farrell
Shane should have been getting on with his life, coming up to his 30th birthday, loving life and enjoying his career, but he met his end in a very violent way
Anybody who knows the circumstances before 2 August 2011 would know Shane should be alive today
We should not be talking about Shane O'Farrell: he should be living his life with his family
One would have to be completely incompetent or complicit to accept as an accident the circumstances that led up to the events of the 2 August 2011
This was an accident waiting to happen because of gross negligence and missed opportunities in the conduct of the local police force and the judicial system, which at best were completely incompetent and at worst bankrupt
The system completely failed Shane and the O'Farrell family, even to this day
There has been a catalogue of failures, a litany so obvious that Shane's family at least deserves a proper explanation
The explanation has not come in the whitewash of the GSOC report
The family has waited for six years to hear something they already knew
I put it to the Minister that the only way the family will get justice is through a public inquiry
We all know that it will not bring Shane back and that the person who killed him on that night probably cannot be prosecuted, but the family can get justice
If the family does not get justice then it is a travesty
The family seeks some sort of closure and that there is some sort of accountability around the person who did this and the system that backed it up
This is all the family looks for
It is a small thing in the grand scheme of things, but that is what the family looks for
When we consider the GSOC report and all the failures of the system, anybody reading it - a lay person or a Deputy - would have serious questions on the role of the local police force and the collusion with the judicial system
Serious questions must be asked about particular people referred to in the report
These are questions for the Minister and the Department of Justice and Equality to answer
The family asks that the Minister would stop prevaricating and give this family some sort of justice through a public inquiry
It will not bring Shane back, but in his memory justice should be done for the family
Earlier this year Senator Frances Black introduced a Bill to the Seanad to end Irish trade with and support for illegal settlements in the West Bank
I understand a debate and vote will take place in the very near future
The Bill is legally sound but it will take political will to implement it
The people of Ireland have elected us as Deputies and I believe they demand that we compel the Government to do something about the State of Israel at the moment
Even today, Israel has announced 3,500 illegal houses in the West Bank
This morning I spoke to a doctor in Gaza who said the situation there is unspeakable, and it is unspeakable what Israel has done to the people of Gaza
If there is anything the Tánaiste can do, as a Deputy elected by the people of this country, he should vote on this Bill and implement it in order to send a message to the State of Israel
It would also send a message to the Palestinian people that we are on their side and against the State of Israel
Will the Government support the Bill?
Will the Government support the Bill?
I do not know if the Minister of State saw the grotesque pictures last Tuesday from Jerusalem of the American Embassy, the Israeli authorities and an entire parcel of rogues – Zionists, right wing Christians and all sorts – celebrating the move of the embassy to Jerusalem
It was grotesquely triumphalist on a day that 60 people were murdered in Gaza
Those 60 people were unarmed and included eight children
One child was only eight months old
It was ultimately depressing to see 60 people murdered
That quantifies the level of desperation experienced by ordinary Palestinian people at their situation
Occupation affects the mind and body and makes one desperate but the will of the Palestinian people will not be mown down by Israeli bullets
I know the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade met the Israeli ambassador a few days ago
He said he was shocked and dismayed
These are weasel words
This Government does not have the bottle to say what is required to the Israeli ambassador
People want to know what it will take for the Israeli ambassador to be told to pack his bags
Will it take 100, 1,000 or 10,000 Palestinian deaths? Where will the line in the sand be drawn? Israel is not a normal state
It is an apartheid and racist state
It was built on blood and it survives on blood
The Irish Government can do something about this situation
Sometimes these debates can be quite abstract in terms of what we can do but there are a number of practical steps that the Government can take
Since 2012, the Irish Government has bought €5
6 million worth of Israeli armaments, including €1
2 million worth of Israeli drones
Most people would be shocked to hear that the Irish Government is buying arms from Israel while the Israeli army is killing thousands of Palestinians
That is one practical measure the Government can take
It can stop purchasing military hardware for the Irish Army from Israel
The other thing the Government can do is support the Control of Economic Activities (Occupied Territories) Bill 2018 proposed by Senator Frances Black
It is a very sound Bill which would end Irish trade with and support for illegal Israeli settlements in the West Bank
The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has said that he will look at that Bill again in June but I urge the Government to support it
These are two practical actions the Government can take although I am not sure it will do so
We will have to wait and see
In 1987, this country was the first in the world to ban all goods from apartheid South Africa
It can be done if the will is there
People are horrified to see what has happened and what will continue to happen
As a country we have shown amazing support for and solidarity with the Palestinians and the least we can do now is to tell the Israeli ambassador to get the hell out of here because he is not welcome
If the Government does not do that and if it keeps buying arms from Israel, then it is complicit in this murder and mayhem
Our support is always with the Palestinian people and never with the Zionists because they are murdering bastards
That is what they are - murdering bastards
Kenny Tynan is a father of four from Roscommon who has been diagnosed with brain cancer
He is treating his condition with medicinal cannabis
A number of weeks ago the Customs and Excise seized his medication which is prescribed by a doctor in Spain
Noreen O'Neill is a mother of one from Kerry who has pleaded for the Government to provide access to medicinal cannabis for her son Michael who has been treated with ten anticonvulsant drugs without success
In January she began to administer CBD oil to her son and in the space of three days he became seizure-free
She said CBD oil has done what 13 months of treatment involving ten anticonvulsants has failed to do
Kenny and Noreen are not the only ones in this situation
People in this State have been forced to emigrate, go public, go to the black market and to break the law
Medicinal cannabis, which I have in my hand, is what it is all about
The Government has issued seven licences for the product
For some it is medicine while for others it is illegal
The law is completely broken on this issue
It is up to the Government to legislate on the issue
If the Government does not legislate it will let down thousands of people that are using this medicine
What about our Bill?
I wrote to the Minister and he has not come back to me
I would like the Minister of State to comment on the continuing purchase of Israeli drones by the Irish Defence Forces
Does the Minister of State not find it abhorrent that this State buys any sort of military equipment from Israel? This is a state that has killed 50 unarmed protesters, including journalists and children, on the Israeli-Gaza border over the past eight weeks
They were shot dead, some of them in the back
Israel also routinely jails children under military court
This is not a normal state
People will be sickened to their stomachs that the State buys any sort of military equipment from the state of Israel
The company in question from which the UAVs were purchased, Aeronautics Defence Systems Limited, states on its website that it sells battle-trained and battle-hardened drones which have been trained in Iraq and Afghanistan
I am sure the drones have also been used in the occupied territories of Palestine
There is blood on the hands of the Minister of State
He is complicit with the Israeli Government when buying any sort of military equipment
The vehicles are not benign; rather, they are meant to carry out surveillance and to destroy
There is, unfortunately
There is blood on the hands of the Minister of State
There are pictures of what is happening on the Israeli-Gaza border
The Israeli army is using drones to drop gas canisters on protesters, resulting in people having respiratory problems, inflammation and bleeding
As I said, 50 people have been killed
The Minister does not get it
Israel is not a normal state
It is a racist and apartheid state and this State is buying arms from it which are being used against Palestinians and ordinary people across the world
The Department of Defence defended the cost of UAVs last year
What about the cost of Palestinians? The Department did not think about that
Does the Minister of State think that Israel, which has killed 50 innocent people, is a normal state? Did he think apartheid South Africa was a normal state? Does he think it is acceptable that this State buys any sort of military equipment from a state which has killed thousands of Palestinians? If the Minister of State can give me a good answer to that question he will not have blood on his hands
Why not? Will the Minister of State tell me why?
The Minister of State has not answered the question

The Minister of State has not answered the question
I commend Deputy Browne on bringing this motion before the House
It is a very worthwhile debate to have
I commend Senator Joan Freeman on her chairmanship of the Committee on Future of Mental Healthcare and her staff
I have been on the committee since January and it has been an education to say the least
I knew there was a crisis but I did not realise its extent and profundity
It is important not to bad-mouth the health service in which there are some fantastic people at work, but the reality is that there is a crisis
Anyone on the committee will echo what I have to say in this regard
The crisis relates mainly to the retention and recruitment of staff, pay and conditions, waiting times for early intervention, in particular around CAMHS, understaffing and lack of resources
These are endemic problems in our health services
Deputy Neville made a very important point
Someday, we will have an ideological debate on this issue
I agree that there is a great deal to be said about quality of life and alienation in society
As a socialist, I believe that many issues relating to mental health are attributable to the system under which we live
It is a very competitive and individualistic system rather than a collective one
Collective joy sometimes brings the best out of people
We are social animals
Deputy Neville and I might have that ideological debate over a cup of tea sometime
I turn to the serious issues around waiting times and pay and conditions
The reality is stark
In 1984, we were in a recession in Ireland but 14% of the health budget was spent on mental health services
In 2004, that went down to 7
3% while in 2015 it went down to 6%
I presume it has increased by 0
5% in 2018 but that is nowhere near the 8
6% stipulated in A Vision for Change or the European level of approximately 12%
There is a disparity of 6% there and people want to engage and seek those services
That is the crux of the problem
When there is a lack of access to mental health services and people must wait to see a psychologist or for speech and language therapy and more serious services, there are deaths
That is the reality
People have been let down by the system and the Government, which is unacceptable
There are people who should be alive today but the system failed them
If more staff and resources are put in place and people benefit from early intervention, common sense suggests that it gives them a chance
It will not save everyone, but it can surely save some
I do not know if other Members saw the recent episode of the RTÉ documentary series "The Big Picture"
It was on CAMHS and the lack of intervention for young people and it was heartbreaking
It should be a flag for all of us here
I touched last week on the RTÉ news item on patients in prison who cannot access the Central Mental Hospital due to a bed shortage
The director of the hospital has said this is completely unacceptable in Ireland in 2018 and I agree
Finally, there were some very good contributions by organisations such as the Psychiatric Nurses Association, PNA, the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, Pavee Point, BeLonG To, the Migrant Rights Centre and many mental health service organisations
They have been educational and important
However, the main issue is that this document should not be left to gather dust somewhere
I am sure there are thousands of documents that look and feel great but never see the light of day
The recommendations have to be put into practice, and only the Government can do that
They are the people who can implement this
It probably will not be implemented in its entirety but surely some of the recommendations Members have mentioned must be implemented
Otherwise, we will be talking about this issue constantly, and people will die
People will be let down by the system and they will die
It is good we are having this debate
We have had a debate on this issue in this House on numerous occasions during the past two years
It is healthy to have this debate
I understand Deputy Browne's Bill is largely aspirational
It has much merit
Ensuring there is parity between our physical and mental health is very important, but the reality is very different
Other Deputies have stated that 6% of our health budget is spent on mental health services but largely in Europe the expenditure on this sector is approximately 12%
Where there is a lack of funding, one finds a shortage of staff and that people fall through the cracks
I want to bring to the attention of the Minister and Members an article reported in the newspapers at the weekend, which I found extraordinary
The clinical director of the Central Mental Hospital stated that 26 ill patients are currently in prison and cannot get into the Central Mental Hospital
He stated that is completely detrimental to their mental health
They are a danger to themselves and to other people
He further stated that, under the laws of the land, he is almost in contempt of court for not meeting his obligations as the clinical director of the hospital
Unfortunately, it gets worse
There is capacity for ten extra patients in the Central Mental Hospital but it cannot fill vacancies due to the shortage of psychiatric nurses
That facility has cost a great deal of money but it cannot get staff
That is the crux of the issue
Retaining and recruiting staff, particularly psychiatric nurses, is extremely difficult
Psychiatric nurses are demoralised in some ways because of the state of the health service and they are feeling the pinch
It is extremely important to address the issue of the retention of staff
I am to blame at times for lambasting our mental health services
There are some extremely positive aspects in terms of the staff in those services and the voluntary bodies in the State but when we look deep down there are serious anomalies in the services
Last week's RTÉ programme "The Big Picture", which showed how young people are being failed by the State, would break one's heart
That failure is the result of austerity and lack of funding of our mental health services by successive Governments
We have seen the State fail people when they have sought services
The services fail them, they fall through the cracks and some people die because of that disgraceful situation
There is a shortage of staff
Another issue, which many speakers have raised, is our child and adolescent mental health services, CAHMS, which is in crisis
I am a member of the Joint Committee on the Future of Mental Healthcare
What it has found is damming of our health service
It found chronic staff shortages with staffing levels as low as 47
5% of what was recommended in some regions
The child and adolescent mental health services have only 56% of the number of staff who were meant to be employed
It is pretty bad
The social damage that does is incalculable and people die because of a lack of services
A Vision of Change, which I believe was introduced in 2007, was a very good document but like all documents that come into this House it never gets implemented
A Vision of Change is quite conservative regarding what the funding should be
It is 8
6% in the State but in line with European levels it should be double that
Until we tackle the chronic underfunding, particularly of our mental health services, we will have a constant crisis in our mental health services
I welcome the debate on this issue but until the Government tackles the danger posed by the lack of funding of our mental health services, we will continue to have this debate and people will continue to die
I ask the Minister to make a statement on the sulky racing and horse ownership traditions in Traveller and working class communities
I thank the Minister for his response
Horse ownership, whether in the rural or urban environment, is a very positive thing
The Minister visited the Clondalkin Equine Club last year and saw for himself the positivity connected with owning horses in an urban environment
The majority of horse owners are responsible but there have been some examples of reckless behaviour by individuals who have taken part in sulky racing on main roads
Such behaviour is reckless but the answer is not to ban sulky racing
Some commentators have suggested that sulky racing be banned but that will not work
It will simply drive the practice underground
I welcome the fact that a study of sulky racing is being undertaken
A few friends of mine attended an event at a sulky track in Portmarnock recently
That track, which is not widely known about, is very good and very positive for those who use it
I welcomed what the Minister said in February 2017 about the fact that the urban horse is an integral part of the lives of working people
Sometimes urban horse ownership has very negative connotations but it is actually a very positive thing, particularly for young people in working class communities
Travellers also have been unfairly criticised in the context of horse ownership
Once a year in Crossmaglen a regulated sulky racing event takes place
It is regulated by the police and the local authority in the North
Perhaps something similar could be organised in the South at some point in the future
We should regulate sulky racing rather than banning it and forcing it underground
Regulation will improve safety for the horses and their owners

I want to place on record my welcome for the news that Vera Twomey's campaign to get reimbursement for medical cannabis has succeeded
Her fantastic speech at the People of the Year Awards last week was also welcome
She received a standing ovation in respect of the progress of the legislation
I want to ask the Tánaiste a specific question about the report I am holding, which was commissioned by the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, and published in January 2017 and which relates to cannabis for medical use
This report was published 15 months ago and absolutely nothing has been done in the interim
People are way ahead of this Government in respect of medical cannabis legislation
The recommendation from the HPRA is that an access programme should be set up
The Bill we put forward is in limbo
Will the Tánaiste comment on this matter please?
The submission was made eight months ago
It is good we are having this debate about single-use plastics and the throw-away culture in capitalist society
Most people became fully aware of the crisis after seeing David Attenborough's "The Blue Planet" documentary
People were aware of what plastics were doing to the planet
It was utterly depressing when they opened a whale and found over 200 types of plastic in the belly of the animal, which killed it
Anybody watching would be completely depressed and we need to do something about it
One can get very depressed when one thinks about environmental issues
Sometimes one says to oneself that nothing can be done and the results seem inevitable
There is a new movement on the planet and it is well ahead of Governments, particularly this one
It is the plastic pollution revolution
We do not need the vast majority of things we get in the supermarket
I looked at my green bin yesterday
The packaging and stuff that comes with buying things in the supermarket is just not needed
Most of the stuff that goes into the green recycling bin goes over to China
There is no logic to the wastefulness of society
We are having a debate about coffee cups
Every single plastic coffee cup has to be 100% recyclable
In the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, all the cups are 100% recyclable
I think the same is true in Leinster House
They are not in most coffee places
It is unforgivable
Most people are well ahead of that
I do not know if the Minister alluded to the deposit and return schemes in his speech
There is a fascinating movement going on across the world
Some countries are well ahead and 38 countries have deposit and return schemes
In supermarkets, there are machines that take cans, plastic bottles and glass and give people back money or credit in the supermarket
Every supermarket and shop in this country should have one of those
Most people would agree to that
They have them in Norway and Germany
In Holland, they have one plastic that is completely oil-free
It is a great initiative
The Minister might take up my suggestion to call all CEOs of the big supermarket chains in and explain to them that we want to try to roll this out as a scheme in most supermarkets
I know it cannot be done in every shop
I am sure big supermarkets such as Tesco, Dunnes, Lidl and Aldi would be on for the idea of a kiosk that accepts plastic bottles and gives money out
Another thing I hate, as I am sure anybody who walks around Ireland does, is the use of plastic bottles
Plastic bottles are thrown everywhere
If they were worth 20 cent, little young fellows would collect them
Back in my day, they used to collect glass bottles and bring them down to the supermarket
Placing a monetary value on used plastic bottles would make people recycle
In 2003, in Germany less than 40% of plastic bottles were recycled
Now, since the deposit and return scheme started, 99
9% of all plastic bottles are recycled because of the monetary return
It would be at least a start if the Minister could take that on board
Capitalism is a very dirty system but we can start with something where we can all make a difference
I raise an issue I have raised numerous times in the House, namely, Opposition Bills and in particular to the Bill I put forward a year ago on medicinal cannabis
A meeting of the sub-committee on Dáil reform has been proposed three times and been cancelled three times in March
We talk here about new politics but what I see is completely dysfunctional politics
People are being granted licences by the Minister for Health for medicinal cannabis and have to leave the country
Not only that, it costs €4,500 for three months’ supply
That is in the case of Ava Barry who lives in the Tánaiste’s county of Cork
This issue is a complete mess not only on Opposition Bills, but on medicinal cannabis
While the House fumbles, people are suffering
What is the Tánaiste's view on the detention of Palestinian children in apartheid Israeli jails?
Since 2002, some 1,200 children have been imprisoned in Israeli jails and currently 350 children are in Israeli jails
Most of these children were prosecuted for simply throwing stones at the occupiers in their towns and villages
These children are subjected to torture, ill treatment and abuse
The conclusion from the UNICEF report Children in Israeli Military Detention is damning of the Israeli prison system
It states:
the ill-treatment of children who come in contact with the military detention system appears to be widespread, systematic and institutionalized throughout the process, from the moment of arrest until the child's prosecution and eventual conviction and sentencing
It is understood that in no other country are children systematically tried by juvenile military courts
This blatantly goes against the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and international law
Israel is the only country in the world that prosecutes children in military courts
Did the Tánaiste raise the issue with the Israeli Prime Minister, Mr
Netanyahu, when he visited Israel in January? Did he raise the case of Ahed Tamimi?
While that all sounds well and good, most Irish people will ask why we treat Israel like a normal state - like any other state in the EU or across the world
Israel is an abnormal state
It is an apartheid state that detains not only children but also hundreds of thousands of ordinary Palestinians fighting against occupation
There are similarities between apartheid South Africa and apartheid Israel
We should not engage in any trade whatsoever with the state of Israel
Most people in the House probably do not know that we have imported €14
5 million worth of Israeli military goods
That military equipment is being used by the Irish military and it is being used by the Israeli military against Palestinians
While what the Tánaiste said sounds good, he should take action to support his words and ban all Israeli military goods from coming into Ireland in order to show his solidarity with the Palestinian people
Does the Tánaiste really believe that?
Of course, the Tánaiste knows the truth
He should not insult my intelligence
What about expelling Israelis?

Yesterday marked International Women's Day
I was one of thousands who joined with our sisters to celebrate, support and show solidarity to women not only in Ireland but across the world
The atmosphere on yesterday's march was electric and was probably the best International Women's Day march I have ever been on in Dublin
The main theme was repealing the eighth amendment
Hopefully next year, we will celebrate its removal from the Constitution
The vast majority of those who took part in that march never had a vote in Ireland's draconian abortion laws
Young people, particularly, are clamouring for change
They are not prepared to allow the 35 years of fundamentalism by the State and the Catholic Church to define their future
Today we are one step closer to trusting the people of this country and for women to decide on their bodily autonomy
What it comes down to is that people who do not want to see abortion in this country do not trust women
It is about moral control and the institutions which had control over everyone's lives, and especially women, losing that control
Abortion is a reality in Ireland
Twelve women a day travel for a termination, and in my own constituency of Dublin Mid-West two women each week, more than 100 each year, travel abroad for terminations
This Bill does not seek to make abortions compulsory, but is about decriminalising abortion in this State and, more importantly, decriminalising women for making that choice
These women are not criminals
They have gone on this journey to Britain or elsewhere feeling as though they have been criminalised by the State and the church
It is about supporting those women who have made that deeply personal decision, medically and legally
Who has the right to judge them? I do not nor do Members here, the State and particularly not the Catholic Church
The Catholic Church has a nerve to judge women in this country considering its particularly hideous history here
They are hypocrites
People power and the testimony of individual women have brought us to this juncture, not politicians, the church or the State
Only those aged 53 years or over had the chance to vote on this issue in 1983
I did not have a vote
The Minister for Health did not have one
It has been 35 years of hurt, not for us but for the women who have never had a choice
That is a shameful length of time to elapse
It is time to right the terrible wrong in this country and wipe away the past to give people, especially women, in this country a future and a choice
I have spoken, but I will speak again
Today I speak on behalf of my mother and the many other women who went through mother and baby homes in the dark recesses of our past, a past which cannot be forgotten
Many women today live with that past and have to look to the future in order to get on with their lives
Five years ago in this House, the then Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, made a promise to establish a memorial to the women of the Magdalen laundries
After five years, nothing has happened
As for the redress scheme, I note seven women have died without being compensated
Time is of critical importance as many women who went through mother and baby homes are growing older
I understand a special event for Magdalen survivors will take place on 5 and 6 June in the Mansion House
One of the key recommendations from Mr
Justice Quirke in 2013 was that a gathering should take place
I ask the Minister to comment on whether the Government can contribute to or support the event
The Justice for Magdalenes research group has expressed deep disappointment at the failure of the Government to contact survivors on its behalf
The research institute has asked the Department of Justice and Equality to contact survivors on its behalf in order to invite them to the event in the Mansion House because the Department is the only body which has all of the names
The 800 survivors will be able to discuss the best way to memorialise the past and deal with their future on 5 and 6 June
One of the recommendations from survivors is that when a building in Sean McDermott Street is sold, some of the space should be used for public housing
It is a testament to the women who were brutalised by the church and State that their desired legacy is to leave something for the future for the many people who find they cannot get a home in the State today
Is the Government supporting the event being held on 5 and 6 June? Can it contribute to or cover the costs for the many people who will attend? It is extremely important that it does so, given that in 2013 the then Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, said he would actively memorialise the survivors of mother and baby homes
Nothing has happened, which is an insult to the women who have survived
I acknowledge there has been a redress scheme but certain people have not received any redress
A memorial is essential because this is a part of the past that cannot be wiped out and which we should address in more ways than one
I would like to welcome everybody in the Gallery
It is always good to see people there
I cautiously welcome the motion, which will allow us to finally ratify the UNCRPD after a long and arduous battle
I sincerely hope that the political will to address the human rights of people with disabilities, which has been absent for a very long time, will emerge in a real and meaningful way
I urge the Government to agree to sign up to the UNCRPD optional protocol as an indication of its commitment to the right of people with disabilities to complain to the UN about issues in respect of which the State may be in breach in the context of the UNCRPD
This will also provide an important advocacy tool for people concerned about violations of their rights
I pay tribute to the many disability activists who have fought with courage and determination to get us to this point
I particularly want to remember and acknowledge the work of disability activists who are no longer with us
I refer to people like Mr
Martin Naughton, Mr
Donal Toolan and Mr
John Doyle, who participated in many campaigns that sought to win full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all persons with disabilities
They challenged us to understand disability as a human rights issue
Finally ratifying the UNCRPD will be a lasting tribute to their work
It is shocking that it has taken so long to get to this point
Many people with disabilities have suffered as a result
The motion to ratify without having made the necessary legislative amendments highlights the misleading and untrue nature of the statements that the Government has presented year after year as an excuse for not ratifying the convention
It worries me that the legislative amendments have still not been made, and I am concerned about the barriers this will present to full compliance with the UNCRPD
However, I believe that an explanation and an apology should be offered to people with disabilities for using this excuse as a delay of ratification, when in fact ratification could have proceeded a long time ago
As Ireland is the last EU member state to ratify the UNCRPD, the Government has a lot of work to do to introduce the rage of measures needed to ensure that people with disabilities have full and equal rights to participate in society as all other citizens do
Once Ireland has ratified the UNCRPD, quite correctly, we will be monitored and examined by the UN
We should immediately take on board the lessons of our closest neighbour, the UK, in terms of its performance in regard to the UNCRPD
A report published in 2016 by the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities found that Britain's austerity policies "systematically violated" the rights of disabled people
In this country, successive Governments' policies of austerity disproportionately affected people with disabilities, many of whom were already living on incomes below the poverty threshold
With cuts to vital services, independence payments, independent living funds, respite care grants, education supports and transport, many people with disabilities, who also experience higher levels of unemployment, are now living in far worse positions than they ever were
Poverty and the rate of consistent poverty among people with disabilities have increased
In conclusion, I call on the Government to publish, as a matter of urgency, a clear deadline for the completion of all remaining areas of law which remain as legislative barriers to full ratification of the UNCRPD
Is the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade not here?
Some of the reports coming out of eastern Ghouta are horrific
Over the past nine days, 600 people have been killed, including 150 children
The reports are literally unbelievable - a massacre of civilians
It seems like the suffering of the ordinary Syrian people is never-ending
Many people who watch the news feel a sense of hopelessness
I certainly do when I see the horrendous situation in Syria
There is something that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade can do
He is not helpless
He should immediately call the Russian ambassador and ask why the latter's country is bombing eastern Ghouta, where 150 children and 600 people overall have been killed
He should ask how the ambassador can justify the indiscriminate bombing of hospitals and schools and the slaughter of people while the world watches on
In Deputy Bruton's capacity as a Minister, he should immediately have the Russian ambassador to Ireland called to justify the war crimes with which the latter's Government is assisting the murderous Assad regime
I will restate what I said - it is imperative that the Russian ambassador be called to account for the war crimes that his country is committing
That discussion should not be a past or passing thing
The ambassador should be brought before the Tánaiste and asked directly how his country can justify killing hundreds of people, not only in Ghouta, but also in Aleppo and other cities across Syria
He should be demanded to appear
That is the least the Government can do, not only for the poor suffering people of Syria, but also for the people of this country and the Syrians residing in Dublin who are asking what is happening in Syria
People are being slaughtered
He should be made accountable for the crimes of his country
Will the Minister, Deputy Bruton, give a commitment that the Russian ambassador will be summoned immediately to be questioned by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade?

In 2014, the then Minister of State at the Department of Health, former Deputy Alex White, signed into regulation the use of Sativex, a cannabis-based medicine for patients with multiple sclerosis, MS
The drug is not yet available on prescription or under the drug purchase scheme
Nobody who needs Sativex in Ireland can get it
If the Taoiseach has the time, and I will question him next week in this regard, he should look at a report broadcast by RTÉ in December on Paddy Doyle, an author who has MS and cannot get a prescription for Sativex
This issue also throws into question the cannabis action programme for which the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, has set out guidelines
The Minister has referred to the guidelines on numerous occasions in the House but there are no guidelines and no programme
When will the guidelines be published? People are waiting for the programme to get up and running
Five licences
There are no guidelines
I have been told by a very good source that there are no guidelines

The withdrawal of Versatis patches from the drugs payment scheme and the medical card has been a debacle
Somebody should put his or her hand up and say that he or she has got it very wrong
Those who benefit from the patches, numbering tens of thousands, are being denied this medication that gives them relief
I know the HSE has said it is based on clinical grounds but most people listening in or who have been on radio or television think it is a monetary decision
A number of people contacted our office about this, and to say they are distraught is an understatement
They are going through life with a condition that has chosen them
They have not chosen the condition of chronic pain or neuropathic pain
The patches give them some sort of relief
The decision by the HSE has put those people outside of the reach of these patches
The HSE might save money in the short term but it will cost the HSE much more money in the long term and hardship, particularly for the people benefitting
I know the Minister remarked this morning that a radio station should not make decisions
I think that is a flippant remark and I do not know if the Minister meant anything by it
I know clinicians make these decisions but I ask for the HSE to repeal this decision
The system is overly bureaucratic and compassion gets lost in bureaucracy
I acknowledge that there is an appeals mechanism and that appeals are dealt with on a case-by-case basis, but surely this is putting people through unnecessary suffering and bureaucracy
One in eight people suffer from chronic pain and a huge volume of opiates would be required to treat those patients
Versatis patches are less harmful to such patients in the short and long term
I listened to "Liveline" last Friday and I heard one caller say that they were real people with real evidence and real pain
That says it all
The HSE should listen to people rather than make bureaucratic decisions that will have a huge impact on them

He is the ideologically driven one
They are catching the Tánaiste up here
On 18 January, Nicole Fox Fenton, affectionately known to her family as "Coco", died by suicide
Nicole was 21 and had her whole life in front of her
Nicole's mother, Jackie, has given me permission to speak today about her beautiful daughter
Nicole was bullied to death, not only online but in reality and in her daily life
Bullying is poisoning virtual reality and driving some young people to utter despair
Nicole's death is not the first and it probably will not be the last
What is the Government doing to address bullying, in particular of young people?
I welcome those in the Visitors Gallery and it is good to see so many people there
I congratulate my comrade, Deputy Bríd Smith, on this very good Bill
I believe it is a good combination of red and green and it is a measure that puts down a marker for this country and other countries that the over-reliance on fossil fuels is unsustainable
Even though it is a limited measure in terms of climate change and the environment, it sends out the right message on any future exploration in this country
Fossil fuels are the past and renewable energies are the future
There can be no doubt that human activity driven by the profit system and capitalism has had and is having a detrimental effect on people, the climate and wildlife
We talk about the environment but, in the same vein, we have to talk about why the environment is being slowly destroyed
The elephant in the room starts with a C - it is capitalism
Capitalism destroys the planet constantly
Those who do not believe in climate change are in denial
What capitalism is doing to the earth is a clear and present danger
The deputy director of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research at Manchester University, Kevin Anderson, states that in order to deliver on the 2° Celsius climate warning target agreed at the UN conference in Paris almost three years ago, radical and rapid cuts in consumption among the world's richest consumers, who are the biggest polluters, and a re-ordering of economic priorities are necessary
I could go through a list of environmentalists, academics and politicians who constantly give the same narrative
There are others in the House who will probably disagree, but capitalism is the clear and present danger
It is why we have climate change and are at the point of climate catastrophe
In order to make that transformation, we must transform the society we live in and the economic system that perpetrates those crimes
For the good of everyone who lives on this planet, we must address these issues
This Bill goes some way to doing that but we must change the system overall
The story of rural broadband is a damning indictment of the love affair of establishment parties with privatisation
In 2007, 2012 and 2014, all Ministers with responsibility for communications promised broadband for rural Ireland
In reality, over 800,000 houses in rural Ireland have no access to broadband
To give the debate historical context, I note the hypocrisy of Fianna Fáil in tabling this motion when it was the party which privatised Telecom Éireann in 1999
We all know what has happened since
The hundreds of thousands of people who bought shares in that privatised company lost 30% of their money
The only winners in that plunder were vulture capitalists
Even worse, albeit it is only a footnote to the debate, two banks, Merrill Lynch and AIB, made €94 million from the flotation debacle
It makes me nauseous when I see that
The new company, Eircom, was sold a number of times and had its assets plundered in turn to pay huge dividends to vulture capitalists
In the orgy of greed and privatisation, they saw no need to invest in broadband facilities, in particular in rural parts of Ireland
This is the legacy with which people in rural Ireland are faced
The latest events further evidence the cherry-picking that goes along with the national broadband plan
Eir was allowed to cherry-pick 300,000 homes, or one third of those in need of the service
Why were these 300,000 homes removed from the overall tender for broadband? We can only assume these were the easiest and most profitable houses to connect
The effect of this was that the third bidder, SIRO, pulled out of the tender process
After that, Eir got its way and also pulled out to leave a sole bidder to supply broadband in Ireland
That company is Enet
It makes one wonder whether this was the intention all along and whether a sweetheart deal was done with these multinational companies to determine who would be the end bidder
The whole saga is an absolute debacle and the losers are the people in rural Ireland who cannot access broadband, which is something I take for granted where I live
In fact, for most people in Dublin having 4G broadband is something they take for granted, yet other citizens cannot get access to broadband because of privatisation and the ideological mistakes of both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil
People living in rural areas have been disadvantaged by their bankrupt policies
If there is anything to come out of this - I know that the Minister will not agree with me ideologically - it is that privatisation does not work
The service needs to be in public ownership to give people what they need
Privatisation has been a complete failure
This time last year the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, commissioned a report, Cannabis for Medicinal Use - A Scientific Review
Not only has nothing happened in that time, the Government has stalled the Bill to legislate for medicinal use because of a money matter
The Taoiseach said yesterday that we exported our problems and imported our solutions but, at this moment, families and individuals are leaving this country for Spain and Holland because they cannot get access to medicinal cannabis
As the leader of this country the Taoiseach has to show leadership to the Minister Deputy Simon Harris, so that he lifts the money matter
There are four people who have licences for medicinal cannabis and they have to pay €11,000 per year for medication but they cannot get it
I ask that we bring in legislation for this immediately
The Taoiseach has to show leadership on this
I welcome the lifting of the ban which keeps licensed premises closed on Good Friday
I have one issue for the Minister of State, which others may have already raised
Workers in public houses have two certain days off a year
Will these workers be compensated in any way? It should not be compulsory to work on that day
As far as I know public house workers have had that day off with pay
Perhaps the unions and the vintners associations could come to some agreement so workers are happy in this regard
If the pubs are open and if workers are working on the day they should be properly paid and it should not be compulsory
Ireland is changing
When I was growing up, the Catholic Church was the predominant institution
For young people today, that institution is greatly weakened
In 1983, the Catholic Church was a very powerful institution
Ireland is a very different place from what it was in 1983
Social issues that dominated the country for so long, such as divorce and gay marriage, have become commonly accepted
In the 35 years since the referendum, women were shamed terribly by the State and the church
The history of those 35 years has been barbaric and an affront to women's health and rights
There has been a litany of abject failures that have imprisoned women and let women die for the sake of religious and political fundamentalism
The movement for choice is as powerful as it ever was
Women will no longer tolerate the hypocrisy of being second class citizens in this State
This movement has largely never been able to challenge the Constitution in respect of a constitutional right to choice
It has been a prisoner of that concept
Those who trivialise and demonise a woman's right to choose ultimately do not trust women to choose
I trust women to make the decision on what is right for them and their families
Only women can make that choice
Over 100 women in the constituency I represent travelled for an abortion last year
At present, women can be sent to jail if they are in possession of the abortion pill
If that sounds outlandish, in the North women in possession of abortion pills and people who prescribe them can be dragged through the courts and sent to jail
That is absolutely barbaric
The eighth amendment belongs to the past
A woman's right to choose belongs to the present and the future
I appeal to those who are yet to decide
They can transform this debate and empower everybody on the side of the debate for getting rid of the eighth amendment to the Constitution
It is time to give women and citizens a chance to make that decision on our Constitution
The party I represent has a proud history of representing women and this issue
It is an issue that can be divisive, but it is time for this generation to make the decision and have a referendum once and for all on giving women the right to choose
I welcome this Bill because anything that strengthens tenants' rights is welcome and progressive
The rental market in Ireland is a racket
It is a racket where some unscrupulous landlords make fast profits and the Government has created the conditions for this
We can argue about the housing, rent and homelessness crisis but the Government has created the conditions for those
It has passed tax laws and given generous tax breaks to corporate landlords, who buy cheap and rent high
A REIT company bought a lot of apartments cheaply after the crash and rents them for very high prices
The rental market in Dublin is spiralling out of control and rents are 18% higher now than in 2007
I hear horror stories on a daily basis, one of which I raised with the Minister's predecessor
Landlords are now asking for people on homeless HAP as they do not want ordinary HAP any more
With homeless HAP they get 20% more, up to €1,900 for a two or three-bedroomed house
This is absolutely outrageous
How can people afford that? These landlords should be wearing balaclavas because they are robbing people, including the Government
Until we challenge a system where people are left to the private market we will continue to have this social disaster
The Minister will utter platitudes to the effect that he will try to implement these measures but this is ideologically driven by the Minister's party
It is no coincidence that one fifth of Deputies are landlords
What does that say? It says that the Government has a vested interest in landlordism
When we got rid of the British in 1922, there were Irish landlords who were even more unscrupulous than the British and that is what we have today
We will continue to have the problem until the Government starts to challenge the system
Last year 15 cyclists lost their lives on Irish roads, the most in a decade; 2017 turned out to be an  The Minister's colleague tabled a Bill last year, the Road Traffic (Minimum Passing Distance of Cyclists) Bill 2017 of which I was quite sceptical at the start but on getting more information in recent months I think it is a Bill worth bringing forward to the next Stage
Any legislation that saves one cyclist's life in this country is worth debating
I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this issue
Those living with phenylketonuria, PKU, have been engaged in a protracted campaign to get access to the drug, Kuvan
Over the past eight years, access to Kuvan has been assessed and rejected by the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics, NCPE, on two occasions, namely, in 2009 and 2017
That process is questionable when it comes to orphan drug assessments
A review into all orphan drugs is under way and that should be welcomed by all parties in the House
Even though Kuvan is readily available in most European countries, it is not available for those living with PKU in Ireland
The drug has the potential to transform a person living with PKU
The irony, incredibly, is that the drug is made in Cork and that Ireland has the highest rate of PKU, a genetic condition, in the world
I understand a decision will be made on provision of the drug soon
Hopefully, the Minister of State will have good news and there will be a positive outcome for those living with PKU
The issue of orphan drugs has been raised a few times since I became a Member
The people requiring them have rare diseases and they cannot access certain drugs
There is clinical evidence but there is also the issue of a price being put on these conditions and on people's lives
The Minister of State will probably agree that is completely unacceptable in society
Hopefully, he will have good news and those living with PKU will get the good news this week to the effect that they can access this drug
All Members received an email from the PKU Association of Ireland earlier
The association does amazing work for those living with the condition
I had no knowledge of PKU until a few months ago
It has been enlightening and educational to find out about the condition and how it can be treated
All members received the email and the PKU community is hoping that there will be a positive outcome on Thursday
I know the Minister of State said the ultimate decision is for the HSE but I hope there can finally be some good news for those living with PKU in Ireland

When the unacceptable becomes acceptable we have a major problem not only in our health service, but in society
I know the Minister said over the Christmas period that the trolley crisis is unacceptable - he said the same last year
It is somewhat Orwellian to say it is unacceptable but it is acceptable
It is similar to the housing crisis, whereby the Taoiseach said it was normal
It is abnormal to have 8,000 people in emergency accommodation
Over the past decade, previous Ministers for Health have described the perennial health crisis as the trolley crisis
People want to know why this is happening
There is a reason that everything happens
Due to the fact that we are politicians, there is a political reason that there is a trolley crisis in our health service
That political reason is a political choice on the part of Fine Gael over the past six years and by Fianna Fáil in previous years
Politically and ideologically, thousands of beds were taken out of the health service
As a result, we now have a health crisis
I have worked in the health system alongside some amazing and fantastic people
However, the demoralisation of health service staff is pretty bad
Front-line staff are demoralised by the ongoing crisis
It is a plague on the houses of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael that the crisis is ongoing
The debate earlier today was nauseating
The Taoiseach sparred with Deputy Martin about which beds were taken out of the system in the decade during which Deputy Martin was a Minister
Nobody really wants to know that, rather people want to know that their mothers, fathers or brothers are not left on trolleys
People do not forget that
Seeing one's mother suffer stays in one's mind forever
I know the Minister does not want to see that, but this is the system that has been created as a result of ideology
There is an answer to every question
In 2018, not one person should be on a trolley, never mind 600
We have a system that the Minister believes in and perhaps he is coming around to Sláintecare and so forth, which is fine, but we have a two-tier health system
Once there is such a system, there will be a perennial crisis such as this
It is not acceptable and normal for anybody to be on a trolley in 2018
If it becomes normal, we can all walk out of this place
A Cheann Comhairle, along with my colleagues I wish you and the staff a happy Christmas
Before I came into the Chamber I was trying to think of a saying to talk about the ongoing housing crisis
One thing went through my head; I do not know who wrote it
The definition of insanity is continuing to do the same thing over and over and expecting a different result
Over the past two years, the issue of the housing crisis has dominated these benches
The statistics say everything
In 2014, 880 children were homeless in the State while by 2017, that number had increased to 3,100
Obviously, something is dramatically wrong with the current policy
Life in a hotel for that family and those children is unacceptable
I am talking about the long journeys to school, the mental stress on the children and the families, the emotional and behavioural problems that come with that, and not having a place to cook or where the children can play
It is shameful that this has happened, and there is one reason for it
The Minister will not like to hear what I have to say and he probably will not accept it, but it comes down to an ideology
That is the reason we have a homelessness crisis
That ideology is allowing the free market to run amok; it is as simple as that
The banking crisis of 2008 did not come out of nowhere
It was a crisis that was manufactured by the ruling class in this country, of which the Minister's party is part
It comes down to class ideology as well
If people in hotels for the homeless were wealthy, there is no doubt that they would be housed
Public and social housing has become a dirty word
It is not a dirty word
There have been huge successes when it comes to public housing
My family availed of public housing, like many other families, and it was a great success
Sometimes it goes wrong but in the vast majority of cases, it does not
Until this House understands that homelessness and children who are homeless is a by-product of ideology in terms of the Minister's party and Fianna Fáil in the previous Government, and until that is sorted out, we will continue in this situation and it will never end
That is a political statement
Get the violins out
So do I
There are more than 3,000 children in Ireland who are homeless at this moment and Deputy Bailey is playing a violin
I said build more social housing
Come on, of course it is an ideology
That is why there is a crisis for God's sake
Can the Deputy not understand there is a crisis out there because of ideology? The Government just does not understand it
Will the Deputy please stop
Will she just stop
Will the Ceann Comhairle please tell the Deputy to stop?
She would give an Anadin a headache
My question relates to the announcement of Donald Trump's formal recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and the consequences for the region
I do not know who writes the Minister's statements but surely he does not believe that
Surely he does not believe that, as the two-state solution is non-existent? What happened last week was a deeply incendiary act by Donald Trump and was calculated to cause a reaction in the Middle East
Jerusalem will never be the capital of Israel and should never be formally recognised by the EU
This will only embolden both Donald Trump's reactionary supporters in the United States and the reactionary elements of the Zionist Israel of Netanyahu
This legitimises what Netanyahu wants to do
He has no interest in the two-state solution
That is pie in the sky
It is time for the EU to recognise that there is no way to have a two state solution
The only solution is one state in which Palestinians, Jews and Christians all live together as much as possible, peacefully
While there is a conflict here, it is a David and Goliath conflict and at the heart of it Israel is fundamentally not the liberal state that the EU paints it as
It is a racist apartheid state, as much as South Africa was back in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s
The time for treating Israel as a normal state is over
Israel is a cancer in the Middle East
It is there to confront and humiliate Palestinians
What Donald Trump did last week will start another intifada
Indeed, one has already begun in Palestine
That is what Trump has done
His statement that Palestinian matters do not matter was incendiary
Even Netanyahu says that Jerusalem is the capital of the Jewish people
What the hell is that? It is like what we saw in apartheid South Africa
Israel is an apartheid state
As long as the EU and the Irish Government treat Israel as some liberal democracy, we will always have Israel as an apartheid state
Do you believe in apartheid in South Africa?
All of it is occupied
My question relates to the announcement of Donald Trump's formal recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and the consequences for the region
I do not know who writes the Minister's statements but surely he does not believe that
Surely he does not believe that, as the two-state solution is non-existent? What happened last week was a deeply incendiary act by Donald Trump and was calculated to cause a reaction in the Middle East
Jerusalem will never be the capital of Israel and should never be formally recognised by the EU
This will only embolden both Donald Trump's reactionary supporters in the United States and the reactionary elements of the Zionist Israel of Netanyahu
This legitimises what Netanyahu wants to do
He has no interest in the two-state solution
That is pie in the sky
It is time for the EU to recognise that there is no way to have a two state solution
The only solution is one state in which Palestinians, Jews and Christians all live together as much as possible, peacefully
While there is a conflict here, it is a David and Goliath conflict and at the heart of it Israel is fundamentally not the liberal state that the EU paints it as
It is a racist apartheid state, as much as South Africa was back in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s
The time for treating Israel as a normal state is over
Israel is a cancer in the Middle East
It is there to confront and humiliate Palestinians
What Donald Trump did last week will start another intifada
Indeed, one has already begun in Palestine
That is what Trump has done
His statement that Palestinian matters do not matter was incendiary
Even Netanyahu says that Jerusalem is the capital of the Jewish people
What the hell is that? It is like what we saw in apartheid South Africa
Israel is an apartheid state
As long as the EU and the Irish Government treat Israel as some liberal democracy, we will always have Israel as an apartheid state
Do you believe in apartheid in South Africa?
All of it is occupied
I commend the independent rural alliance on the motion
They are pedantic
I will get it right the next time
I commend them on the bulk of their motion but there are certain things with which I do not agree, though they are for another day
Having worked as a care assistant for the past 16 years of my life, and for five years as a home care worker before I came in here, I understand the vital importance of home care work, not only for the worker but for the patients and their families
Whether they are convalescing at a hospital from long-term illness or coming to the end of their life, it is vital to them
Millions upon millions of hours - some 10 million - were cut from home care packages over the past ten years, by the Fianna Fáil-Green Party Government and the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government
Fewer people got a home care package in 2015 than in 2008
A total of 2
24 million fewer hours were delivered and this has had a hugely detrimental effect on people's well-being
I am surprised that nobody has pointed out that, at this moment, 75,000 people are trying to avail of home care packages but only 21,000 are actually availing them
That means a huge gap of 50,000 people
I personally know families in extremely difficult circumstances who would beg public health nurses and doctors for their loved ones to come back home but they cannot provide the service, which has a knock-on effect as these people do not want to be in hospital but want to be at home with their loved ones
There are 50 for-profit home care providers and it is an extremely lucrative business
Most workers are paid between €9 and €11 per hour but the private company charges the HSE double that amount
It is profitable but not efficient from the point of view of the taxpayer
There are many people who are now reaching an older age and who want to be cared for in their home environment rather than in a hospital and it is more cost-effective to do so
One does not want to depict a doomsday scenario of the health services because some amazing people work in the service, such as doctors, care assistants, auxiliary and office staff but there is a two-tier health care system and, like under apartheid, if one has money one can get the best but in the public health system one has to wait and sometimes to beg
According to the Irish Nurses and Midwives Association, 526 patients are on trolleys today
People do not want to be outpatients or in hospitals but want to come home so we support this motion
Hopefully, it can be addressed in a fundamental way, unlike previously
On 1 December last year the Cannabis for Medicinal Use Regulation Bill 2016 that I tabled passed Second Stage and on 9 November 2017 it was agreed that it would go to Committee Stage
Last week, I received two documents on the same day, one from the Ceann Comhairle, for which I thank him, and one from the office of the Minister for Health stating that the Bill will be stifled on a money matter
It is pretty outrageous that people are playing politics with people's lives
The Minister will acknowledge that families, such as Vera Twomey's, and other individuals should never go through the torture that the Twomey family has gone through
They should not be medical exiles in this country
People should be prescribed medication in Ireland
I think the Minister for Health is on our side in some ways and he should let this Bill go forward to Committee Stage
Let us amend it together because it is not perfect, to help citizens of this country
It is the money message
I support the motion
I commend Deputy Murphy O'Mahony on it
It reads well, but is shocking
It is an indictment, not only on neurological services in Ireland but the health service in general
Many Members in this Chamber have been vocal about how health apartheid is rampant in the health service
One sees people who must struggle every day for basic health services
Some of the pointers on the motion are incredible
For example, it refers to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which I raised with the Minister of State on Topical Issues
Ireland signed that 11 years ago and it still has not been ratified
That is a bad start
It also states that 25,000 Irish people each year struggle to access neurorehabilitation services in Ireland
These services are critical for early intervention, which is key to somebody recovering as quickly as possible
I would like also draw attention to the provision of home-care services for neurorehabilitation
That is essential and should be provided in tandem as part of somebody's rehabilitation
I could go on for ever about the lack of services for those with a neurological condition
These conditions range from somebody with epilepsy to somebody recovering from a stroke
There are myriad conditions
We must address those issues, particularly around home care because those who have a condition essentially do not want to be in acute hospitals or nursing homes
Sometimes they want to be at home getting back to their lives they had previously
One can talk in flowery language about the health service in this country
I do not want to be a prophet of doom - sometimes that is easy here - but there is something fundamentally wrong in a society that does not take care of those who find themselves sick not of their making where the health service cannot look after them
It is a terrible indictment, not only of the Dáil but of society
What it comes down to - I do not know whether the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, will agree but there is probably a consensus in this place - is that once there is a two-tier health system, one will always have inequality in it
If one had a one-tier health service, regardless of whether one was a millionaire or somebody on social welfare through no fault of their own, one would at least have greater equality when it comes to the health service and the services that it provides
A two-tier health system leads to exactly what is stated in the motion
One has all these grave inequalities when it comes to people accessing services
Sometimes it is embarrassing to state that one is from Ireland when one sees some of the contents of the motion
It is an embarrassment and yet this is a wealthy country
If one has money in one's pocket or one is wealthy, one can get services but if one is poor or working class, one is at the bottom
That is fundamentally wrong in any society
This is a good motion
It throws up a good debate about the lack of neurological services for those who really need them who, as I stated previously, have conditions not of their making - the conditions have probably chosen them
When they need that help, society should provide them with their needs and if we do not provide it, it is a terrible indictment, not only of this place but of society as a whole
I am happy for the Minister to answer the question
I am sure the Minister is aware and that everyone in this House is cognisant of the human catastrophe that is the Syrian civil war which seems to be unabating
Hundreds of thousands of Syrians have fled Syria in search of refuge
In some cases, families have been split apart not by the chaos of war but the chaos of escaping it
The family reunification humanitarian admission programme is very prescriptive as it does not encompass family members such as brothers or sisters
I welcome the Minister's statement that he would consider providing for some costs of those seeking refuge here
The scheme should be widened, however
The new scheme is very prescriptive
It does not include grandparents, parents or brothers or sisters of a Syrian refugee trying to make a new life for himself or herself here
I welcome the Minister's statement on the costs of relatives of those seeking refuge here
The Minister was correct when he said that we have a housing crisis
However, consider what we are doing about the arms trade and our budget under the PESCO agreement
A lot of money is going into fighting different people's wars, yet we cannot give people who are seeking to get away from war refuge in this country

I seem to have been struck by the curse of Dáil Last Sunday was International Day of Disabled Persons and after 11 years, we still have not ratified the UNCRPD
In fact, Ireland is the only country in Europe not to ratify the convention
Over 200 countries in the world have ratified the convention
Last year, I emphasised that key legislation underpinning the convention could be passed by this House even before the convention is ratified
The Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, has a track record on this, but he has staked his reputation on this matter and it has still not been ratified
Waiting for the convention to be ratified is like "Waiting for Godot"
This is a human rights issue
This is about equality in Ireland
Last week, as the Minister of State will be aware, a good campaigner, John Doyle, who was incredibly vocal on disability, passed away
I will read what he stated in a blog about the non-ratification of the UNCRPD because it is poignant
He wrote:December 3rd is International Day of Disabled People
I hate this day for what it has become
It was to be a day of celebration of inclusion and equality but instead every year we get an endless parade of politicians lining up to put a positive spin on having done nothing to really address the inequalities faced by disabled people
The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with a Disability (UNCRPD) was signed in 2006 by the Irish Government and a full ten years later and several governments on, it has still not been ratified
The lack of ratifying this document has left disabled people with no recourse to enforceable laws which would have given some protection against the myriad of institutional abuses we have seen over the last 10 years
We still have not ratified the UNCRPD
It is incredible
People in this country are extremely angry and they will voice their protest on Saturday at 12 o'clock at the GPO
Has the Minister of State any good news for the 600,000 people with disabilities in this country who want to see this ratified?
That is all well and good - I do not want to be sceptical because I am not a sceptic by nature - but I heard all this, last year and in February
I asked the Minister of State when would this be ratified and he stated it would be a couple of weeks before Christmas
The reply is ambiguous
Can Deputy Finian McGrath give an exact date when the UNCRPD will be ratified? To say that it will be as soon as possible could mean anything
I heard that last year
It could be another year
I am not questioning the Minister of State's bona fides but the reply is too ambiguous
Deputy Finian McGrath must give an exact date when this Convention will be ratified
If he waits for all the legislation and by-laws, we will be waiting forever
The Minister of State even stated this morning in the media that does not have to happen, we would ratify it and then the primary legislation can be legislated for
Can the Minister of State give an exact date when this Convention will be ratified? As I stated, 600,000 people are relying on the Minister of State's words and they are very important words
It is the exact same
It is the exact same

A key recommendation of the national rare disease plan of the previous Government was to establish a rare disease technology review group
I understand there is a chair but no members
The Minister understands and is cognisant of the serious situation in this country whereby citizens cannot get certain drugs because of a very flawed process
This is a life or death situation for citizens and the Minister is aware of this
Will he comment on when this will be set up?
I am quite happy with the Minister's comprehensive response
I hope this situation will never happen again to any individual presenting in this way
I am glad the person did it and I take the Minister on her word in this case
I am quite happy with the Minister's comprehensive response
I hope this situation will never happen again to any individual presenting in this way
I am glad the person did it and I take the Minister on her word in this case
Obviously, I support the Bill
This is a symptom of how society deals with people who find themselves homeless, not because they choose to be homeless but because society makes them homeless
Many Members in this House have stated how many are homeless today
There are 184 rough sleepers in Dublin today
That is 42% more than last year's figure
If anybody finds that normal, he or she is in the wrong game
They would be better off walking out the door here and walking away
That is not normal
The Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, even stated over the weekend that we have not seen the worst of this crisis
The Minister is right but the previous Minister said the exact same, as did his predecessor
Obviously, there is something wrong
I also want to refer to comments that were made about people who are homeless, including by the Minister of State himself, the Taoiseach and others
They were completely crass and insensitive to people who find themselves in a crisis of homelessness
As I said in last week's debate, it is almost like social whitewashing of homelessness, such is the level of debate on the matter
The devices to which this Bill refers are completely crude and dehumanising
The term for them is "defensive architecture", which is quite incredible
This is even worse than the term "gated communities"
The message is "stay away, don't come here"
There are other cities across the world where the situation is similar to that in Dublin but they try to cater, aesthetically for want of a better word, for people who find themselves homeless
I was in Lisbon last year where I discovered that lockers are provided for people who find themselves homeless
Homeless people are provided with lockers to store possessions such as clothes and blankets
I am not saying that is normal
It is abnormal but in a society where homelessness is prevalent, it is a good thing
These devices are completely alien in a civilised society
Any business that erects such devices should be boycotted
It would be a good thing if the Government tried to eradicate homelessness, although I do not think it is capable of doing so
I do not mean that personally in respect of the Minister of State
I do not think Fine Gael is capable of doing it because it is ideologically wedded to a market system and it believes that homelessness is acceptable in a market economy
As long as that belief system prevails, we will always have homelessness
We need to change the system
There are 8,000 people in emergency accommodation, which is a disgrace
There are 190 people homeless in this city today, which is also a disgrace
I urge the Minister of State to support this Bill
While it is largely cosmetic it will send out a message that this is not acceptable and that homelessness is not acceptable
The House has spent many hours debating the ongoing housing crisis
There is, however, another national crisis, namely, in the assessment of needs for children
The Government is continually in breach of the Disability Act 2005
Not only is the system broken but many families are broken because they have not had access to simple assessments of need
A number of cases taken against the Government are before the High Court
The Taoiseach can expect a tsunami of further cases against the Government for breaking the law
I have a simple question
What will the Taoiseach do about this?
I apologise for the earlier confusion
Has the Minister raised the ongoing famine in Yemen with his counterparts in Europe?
I do not know whether the Minister saw last night's "BBC News at Ten" broadcast, which covered the ongoing crisis in Yemen
One can get desensitised to conflict and humanitarian crises across the world
The pictures coming out of Yemen are basically undescribable
Famine and disease are at epidemic levels
Almost 2,500 people have died of cholera since April
Over 12,000 people have died since the start of the conflict in 2015
The famine in Yemen is ongoing
The pictures coming from Yemen are reminiscent of those that came from Africa in the 1980s
It is a serious situation
According to one agency, it could culminate in a nightmare scenario being inflicted on the world
The Minister said he has discussed this matter with his EU counterparts
Can the Minister forward this to his EU counterparts so they can broker some sort of peace agreement and in particular, deal with the blockade, which is having a devastating effect on the Yemeni people?
Perhaps the EU can use its influence on the UN Security Council
A total of 12,000 people have been killed since 2015
The belligerent country of Saudi Arabia is doing most of the killing
It is being armed by the US and the UK
These countries arm Saudi Arabia to the tune of billions of dollars every year
Could the Minister ask his UK counterpart why the UK is arming a country like Saudi Arabia when it is involved in widespread wholesale murder? These people are part of the problem
It is a humanitarian crisis where the ordinary Yemeni people are dying on the streets and dying of malnutrition
The EU should step up and tell the UK that it is arming these people and this country and this is exacerbating the problem

Hear, hear
People Before Profit will support this good Bill
Any measure that will keep families together in a crisis, such as that relating to homelessness, is good
The problem of homelessness seems to have no end
For the Taoiseach to claim we have a situation of normality with homelessness is an insult to everybody's intelligence
I accept that the Government is trying to address legacy issues relating to the homelessness crisis
However, I cannot understand how anybody can believe that having over 8,000 people in emergency accommodation is normal
It is abnormal; it is almost social whitewashing when claiming that this is normal practice in Ireland and across the world
That is an indictment on our society, our housing system and international systems of housing people
How can one find it normal that people are living on the streets when there is an abundance of housing? How can it be normal for hundreds of families and children to live in emergency accommodation? If anybody in the Government or an NGO finds that normal, he or she should resign immediately
There is a bubble in Leinster House where people think it is acceptable that families are in an emergency accommodation
As a Deputy for the Dublin Mid West constituency, I see the problem every day
It is an embarrassment that, in 21st century Ireland, people are living in emergency accommodation while the country is so wealthy and there is an abundance of housing
A new phenomenon has emerged whereby private landlords will ask potential tenants what level of HAP they are on
If the potential tenant is on homeless HAP, the money the landlord gets is exorbitant
For example, a one-bedroom flat in Clondalkin was recently rented for €1,700
That is criminal
The people asking for this kind of money should be wearing balaclavas
However, they will extort that money from tenants and the Government
Private landlords are asking if people have homeless HAP meaning that other HAP recipients are being discriminated against
The whole system is crazy
When we find homelessness normal, we should walk out of this building because this place is no longer fit for purpose
I will only need five
I move amendment No
1:To delete all words after “Dáil Éireann” and substitute the following:“ , notwithstanding the recommendation of the Joint Committee on Health in its Report entitled ‘Report on Scrutiny of the Cannabis for Medicinal Use Regulation Bill 2016 [PMB]’, copies of which were laid before Dáil Éireann on 12th July, 2017, agrees that the Bill should proceed to Committee Stage in order that amendments may be made to the Bill
”I welcome everyone in the Public Gallery
Unfortunately, Vera Twomey is not here today
She collapsed outside the Dáil today
I hope she gets well soon
I know she is here in spirit and that she will be back with us very soon
I stood on this spot a year ago with a great deal of hope in my heart
Obviously, the country was probably behind what we are trying to do
We are trying to give safe and legal access to cannabis for people who need the medication
The hundreds of people I have met over the past year shared my hope that they would be recognised as medical patients
They had hoped that they could have safe and legal access to medicinal cannabis
They had hoped to be able to come out of the shadows of darkness brought about by their illness
It was not an illness they chose
The illness chose them
Today I stand here with despair, unfortunately
I hope I am wrong
This place can grind a person down sometimes, and we are all human
I have been left with a sense of despair
I will never give up in any sense
Over the course of the past year, I believe our Bill has been completely sabotaged
I was rather shocked by the shambolic nature of the pre-legislative scrutiny
I believe it was politically motivated in some ways
It was rigged
Some of the comments made in the Joint Committee on Health were extraordinary, although I am not going to go into them now
I believe the Committee on Health looked for every excuse to stymie progress of our Bill
It is as simple as that
Deputy Harty has said every conceivable negative thing about our Bill
He has never said one positive thing about it, but there are positives aspects to it
I am not saying the Bill is perfect by any means
However, it is always amendable in my eyes
Let us consider all the international evidence
Those responsible had to abandon the compassionate access scheme in Germany because it was so restrictive
The Minister's compassionate access scheme is extremely restrictive
I will explain how restrictive it is
The situation of Ava Barry is instructive
I went to see her in the Netherlands
It was a bittersweet experience
It was sweet to see a child doing very well
However, it was a bitter experience to see an Irish citizen in medical exile in Holland
I came back ten times angrier
I was angry that a child should have to go to another country to get simple medicine
Over there, she can go to the pharmacy
The pharmacist gives out the medication
She gives her money and comes back to her house
Is it not shambolic that an Irish citizen has to go to another country to do that? Ava has been almost seizure-free since she went over there
Under the compassionate access scheme that the Minister is promoting, she would be unable to access the scheme
That is the simple truth
I am keen to dispel some myths about our legislation
I find it rather incredible that one of the pretexts set out in the Committee on Health report was that it would be too onerous to go through the Bill
We are lawmakers
We are elected to the Dáil to change laws
That is our job
If it is an onerous task, then it is worth it
I do not understand that point
What really annoys me is the point about a shortage of peer-reviewed evidence
The evidence is available
It is coming out of people's ears
Of course we need more research
However, it seems that people want to hide behind that until kingdom come
They say there is not enough peer-reviewed research, but there is
It is only that certain people choose to look away
There is ample evidence that people can greatly benefit from the Bill
I have always said that we would look at the Bill objectively with anyone in this room, regardless of political persuasion
I have no problem if people want to take out certain provisions
The main thing is to give people legal access to medicinal cannabis
I have a message for the Deputies in the Chamber who will be voting on this next week
In my eyes, they will be on the wrong side of history, science, public opinion and international recognition
No matter what happens after next week, our fight will continue
The political establishment might be giving up on people, but we will never give up on the people who are in the Gallery
They will never walk alone
I was not sneering
I did not do anything
That is not true
I would like to raise the issue of the way in which drugs to treat rare illnesses such as phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis and muscular dystrophy are assessed by the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics
There seems to be a bias against people with rare illnesses in this country
Not only are they discriminated against by their condition, which they have not chosen, but they are also punished by not being able to avail of drugs to which they should be entitled
I do not wish to be alarmist but there is an emerging crisis in the primary education system
The lack of substitute teachers has led to the traditional student-teacher model becoming quite dysfunctional
On eight occasions there were no teachers to supervise classes in Adamstown Castle Educate Together school in Lucan, which is in my constituency, and that meant classes were put together and students lost out
The Minister is probably cognisant of the emerging crisis but it could get worse
It is more than anecdotal evidence
The chairwoman of a group representing principals of primary schools in Dublin 15 wrote an alarming letter to We have collated the figures for the month of September 2017 alone and they make for disturbing reading – the number of school days when substitute teachers were not available to cover absences in Dublin 15 during September 2017 was 546
As a result, classes are divided and children are being sent to other available classrooms, often at short notice, resulting in disruption and overcrowding in those classrooms
The education of all concerned is significantly compromised on these occasions
Often, special education teachers are required to suspend their support timetables to teach mainstream classes, thereby depriving the most vulnerable children of their vital supports
The principals of schools in Dublin 15 hold a different view to that of the Minister

This month marks the third anniversary of the biggest mobilisation this country has ever seen
Over 150,000 people mobilised three years ago against water charges
I was one of those people
At that time the former Taoiseach, Deputy Kenny, said that this was about more than just water charges
He was right
The people of this country had had enough
They had reached breaking point
During the march, I knew something had changed dramatically in the psyche of working people
They had had enough of austerity
Water charges was the straw that broke the camel's back
Defeat is contagious
If one is constantly defeated, one gets very down
However, in this case the contagion turned into resistance and a confidence in working people
Since then, there have been nine further anti-water charges marches, which have been fantastic
They brought hundreds of thousands of people onto the streets
This gave people confidence and a sense that they would not be constantly defeated
It was great to be involved
From my point of view it politicised, radicalised and mobilised people such that they were confident they could defeat the water charges, which was extremely important
In a parallel universe, had the Government side won and water charges had been introduced, this would have led to a sene of defeat among my generation and the next generation
It is hard to rid oneself of a sense of defeat
When one is constantly defeated one is crippled by the feeling that one cannot do anything or resist anything
Overall, we have defeated water charges
I have no doubt about that
This Bill, more than anything else, is a face-saving exercise
What defeated the water charges was people power
People mobilised on the streets, in their communities and in their workplaces through many forms of resistance, including marching and blocking entrances to estates - in which I was involved along with other residents in Clondalkin - so that Irish Water could not install meters
This action and the boycott of water charges were key in defeating water charges
Fianna Fáil often makes the point that it was the catalyst in the defeat of the water charges, which is laughable, because it was people power that did so
It is great that water charges have been defeated
However, this Bill leaves the door open for future water charges
There is no doubt about that
The Bill is deliberately vague on excessive use and could be open to change in the future
Over the past 35 years we have always been open to the idea that water charges would be introduced in some manner
The key thing is that they will be defeated
They have been defeated now and they will be defeated in the future, which is good
During the water charges debate over the past four or five years, certain things stick out in people's heads
One of the major things was people power
Sticking out in my head - they probably come back to haunt Fine Gael - are the words of Phil Hogan when in May 2014 he very arrogantly said that people's water would be turned down to a trickle but it has not been
The great thing is that the Bill before us has turned the Government's water charges to a trickle
People power has defeated the water charges
In my eyes resistance is never futile
Like all Deputies in this House, we received an email from an impassioned mother whose six year old daughter Maria lives with PKU
I had not heard of PKU until I read the email
Ireland has the highest rate of PKU in the world
As Deputy Deering said, the drug Kuvan has been approved by over 20 countries in Europe
This drug has been proven to be medically beneficial for those living with the condition
Sadly, Kuvan has been rejected twice by the NCPE in the past eight years
This has had a devastating effect on the PKU community
My question is fundamental to many things that happen in this House, to orphan drugs and to people who have rare conditions, not because of their choosing but because of circumstances
The NCPE has said twice that the drug is not to be approved
Obviously, the reason it has not been approved is because the NCPE thinks it is not cost-effective
Will the Minister override its decision and tell the manufacturer of this company to sit down and agree a price? It has been done previously with the cystic fibrosis community regarding the drug Orkambi, so I am asking the Minister to override the NCPE's decision because this drug can greatly benefit those suffering from PKU
This statement does not really mean anything
It is hollow, to say the least
What this comes down to is putting a price on somebody's life
Somebody has made a decision - I do not know if it is the Minister of State - that the price of somebody's life is not worth the price of medication for that
This goes further than providing Kuvan for people with PKU; it involves other orphan drugs like Translarna for people with muscular dystrophy, as was mentioned by Deputy Adams yesterday
Will the Minister of State override its decision and review the assessment done by the NCPE on orphan drugs? The assessment is fatally flawed
People who have conditions not of their choosing but because of circumstances are being medically discriminated against because of price
I ask the Minister of State to review and override the NCPE's decision

I welcome this debate on animal welfare in Ireland, which is very timely
This is one matter in which I have been very involved, along with Deputies such as Deputy O'Sullivan
We have relatively progressive legislation on the Statute Book but despite this we are seeing an increasing number of reports of mistreatment and abuse of animals
It is clear there is a massive gap in resourcing when it comes to enforcement
Organisations such as the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals rely on public donations for up to 90% of their funding
I read the People Before Profit manifesto on animal welfare, which is a really good document, and I will point out three or four elements as I do not have the time to discuss it all
It seeks a full audit of animal welfare issues in Ireland and stricter punishment and serious fines for those who abuse animals for commercial purposes
It seeks promotion of responsible pet ownership through the school curriculum and the introduction of measures requiring all animals but especially pigs and poultry to be provided with adequate space, natural light and opportunities to carry out natural behaviours
There is one issue I want to speak of tonight that is very close to my heart
It is the matter of horse welfare, particularly in an urban environment
When I was a councillor on South Dublin County Council, I was shocked, to understate it, by the number of horses which were impounded, neglected and destroyed
Over the past ten years, tens of thousands of horses have been destroyed in this country
Over a period of four years South Dublin County Council saw up to 1,000 horses destroyed at the cost of approximately €1 million to the taxpayer
As a person who loves horses and all animals, I was shocked by this wanton neglect and cruelty, particularly in a country where the horse is an esteemed creature
I was taken aback by those figures, which can be depressing
As a councillor I wanted to try to do something about it
Over the years the figures have fluctuated
They have gone down a little but they are still way too high
The Minister was in Clondalkin in February for the opening of the Clondalkin Equine Club
It gives young horse owners a place to call their own and it is the first social horse project in Ireland where young horse owners can keep their horses in an urban environment
It is a really good project and although it is not perfect by any means, we are trying to promote education and responsibility in equine matters, as well as everything that comes with it
I have seen the worst equine neglect one could imagine but I have also seen the best equine good practice, and this should be promoted through other county councils around the country
It is a good project
There should be more enforcement to tackle people who neglect horses
Some people should not even own a goldfish, never mind a horse
The majority of people who own horses are responsible and take good care of those animals
There are a small minority of people who are unscrupulous
They are dealers of horses and they do not care about horses, communities that keep horses well or anybody else
Enforcement measures should be taken against them through the police, etc
The Control of Horses Act 1996 is good legislation but it is not enforced
Who was the last person to be sent to jail for abusing, neglecting or abandoning of a horse, or for dealing in horses? I cannot think of any examples
The Clondalkin Equine Project is a really good project
There is something amazing about seeing a young person with an animal
I am not a horse owner, but it is great to see a young person bonding with a horse
They get an education from a horse
The project is not perfect by any means, but what was happening before was not acceptable and now at least we are trying to address the issue
The people who run the equine club have gone down to Limerick and around different parts of the country to promote the idea of a social horse project
Orphan horse ownership is not going to be a panacea, but it is better than what is happening at the moment, where horses are impounded by the council and destroyed and the horse owners and taxpayers are losing out
I attended protests last week about the live exports of farm animals and hare coursing
Hare coursing is bizarre
More than 100 Deputies in this Chamber support hare coursing
I find it bizarre that somebody can get pleasure from chasing a hare around
It is completely alien to me
As long as we live in a society that is profit driven, we will always have cruelty
Industrialised farming is abhorrent, and as long as we live in a profit-driven society, cruelty to animals will exist
People have to speak up for animals
We need a society where animals and human beings try to co-exist without wanton cruelty
Most people are not cruel to their animals
We live in a country that loves animals, but a system is in place where industrialised farming kills animals horribly
We have to try to end it
As Deputy Curran said, this issue has cross-party support
Scoil Mochua in Clondalkin is probably unique
As Deputy Curran said, there are 74 students, most of whom are wheelchair users
They come from 19 different localities including Clondalkin, Ballyfermot and Lucan, as well as counties Kildare, Meath and Wicklow
It is unique in offering preschool, primary and post-primary facilities
As Deputy Curran described, the school is very dilapidated and is not fit for purpose in its present form
Many good schools have been built in Dublin Mid-West
The management and students of Scoil Mochua are looking for equality on that basis
They are in the schools building programme for 2019 to 2021
The management and students are saying this work cannot wait but needs to be fast-tracked and undertaken as soon as possible
I could read out a list of issues that the school has
Some of them are very basic, for example corridors in which two wheelchairs cannot pass each other
The school building has outlived its purpose and it is time a new school is built
The Minister's response is quite positive
We sometimes get negative news when we come in here
I hope the issues raised in the Minister's statement can be overcome
In particular, the issue relating to the land in the local area can be overcome quite quickly by South Dublin County Council
I would like to mention some other parallels
A really good primary school is being built by Stewarts in the Rosse Court area of Lucan
It will be a state-of-the-art facility for children with special needs, etc
I hope the parents, the management and the service users can get what they want and the issues can be fast-tracked so that this school gets up and running as soon as possible

I wish the Minister well in her new job
I probably will not be nice to her after that
She probably will not like what I will say to her
Her predecessor ran a campaign entitled "Welfare Cheats Cheat Us All"
It was wholeheartedly condemned by the majority of Deputies on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Social Protection as vindictive, malicious and mean spirited
It goes against everything we are trying to do for social justice
It was an affront to anybody on social welfare
I do not condone fraud but it is a pretty horrible measure that the name of anyone convicted of fraud is included in a register for three months
I know people have said that register can be online for only three months but who is to stop anybody using that name on social media and sharing it? Deputy O'Dea says there should be an excess of €5,000 but I think it should be got rid of
Last year, at a meeting of the committee I asked an official from the Department of Social Protection how many were convicted of fraud
I asked an official what was the least amount owed by any of the 126 people
The least amount was €726
Had this person been convicted, he or she would have been on a register
I believe wholeheartedly that this is very unfair
Another reason people are up in arms about this proposal is that we can see the other comparisons in society
Look at what is happening in the corporate sector where people evade taxes and are, literally, robbing the State
They do not seem to get any justice
It sticks in people's craw
We have a system that is a class bias system, with one law for the rich and one law for people who are trying to get on
I hope this measure can be taken out of the Bill completely
Some parts of the Bill are progressive but I hope the Dáil can exclude this measure
It would give rise to unintended consequences for data protection and for the liberty of the person
It is a horrible measure and I have no doubt that it was the idea of the Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar
It was his vanity project to get elected
That is his legacy and I hope the Minister, Deputy Doherty, looks upon this and makes it her good guidance to take it out
The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health's report on scrutiny of the Cannabis for Medicinal Use Regulation Bill 2016 was published at 12
yesterday
Before it was published, the Tánaiste's colleague, Deputy Kate O'Connell, appeared on a radio show basically lambasting the Bill
This is not the first time she has lambasted it
It is wholly inappropriate that the Deputy appeared on radio and was severely critical of the Bill before the report was published
The report itself is shambolic, to say the least
It has missed out all clinical evidence on medicinal cannabis
Yes, I have
What will the Tánaiste do about this, because what has happened is that the Bill I introduced has been shelved? The situation in Ireland is that medical refugees are going to Holland and Spain-----
-----to receive medical advice and treatment
The Government has to live with that
The Government has to look at people-----
-----in this country with chronic pain being completely ignored
What is the Government going to do about that?
It was biased from the very start
The HPRA informed us as well
How about opiates?
How about the IMO?
The IMO passed a motion two months ago at its AGM calling for legislative scrutiny of the Bill
That was ignored
I asked Deputy Harty to bring the Bill forward
Yes, and this is a flawed document
This is a flawed document
It is the place
This place is a kip
Was it unanimous?
Kenny
It is not withdrawn
It is not withdrawn
What has gone on in the last few months has been absolutely outrageous
It has been outrageous
I did call it a "kip"
The Deputy has some nerve after his party bankrupted the country
Deputy Durkan has been in here too long
Jurassic Park
I genuinely wish the Minister good luck in his new position
I said the same to his predecessor because this issue transcends any individual or party represented in this House and we have a crisis beyond a crisis
We have a crisis because social, public and community housing have become dirty words
Social housing has come to mean dysfunctional housing, which is bad
The public housing programme has been a huge success overall
There have been projects that have failed, but housing projects across the State have largely been a success
I am from one in Clondalkin
My family moved from Islandbridge flats to Neilstown which is a huge council estate
It had its problems at the start and still has some, but it is an amazing community that grew together and got out of certain situations
We can have these great plans, but the reason we have this housing crisis is that, ultimately, social housing has become a dirty word and is being ideologically driven down
I hope the action plan is a success but I highly doubt it will be
I am trying to be an optimist, not a sceptic
One thing that has been flagged in Rebuilding Ireland is a parcel of land in Clondalkin, where I live, that is owned by the council
It is an 80-acre site and the plan is to sell it off to a private developer
Anyone in this House who thinks it is logical to sell public land to a private developer during the worst crisis in the history of this State would want to get his or her head seen to
Most of these houses will go to the private market
It really does not make sense to sell off land at the height of the worst crisis in the history of the State to a private developer
This land should be for public housing, affordable housing, cheap rental housing and social housing
It is quite simple, and I am sure the Minister will agree with what I say, but I think Rebuilding Ireland, unfortunately, will just be another dead end

What is the status of the commitments in the programme for Government on improving the lives of persons with disabilities?
The Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, has been a very strong advocate for people with disabilities and all that comes with that
I have probably asked him this question numerous times since I have been elected, namely, when will the ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, take place? Since the Government came into office more than a year ago it said the ratification of the convention would be advocated
Fourteen months later the convention has still not been ratified
I find that extraordinary
This week we have a raft of Bills being pushed through the House
We have a Bill about the Rugby World Cup, which is very important
I am a big rugby fan myself
That is one Bill that is being pushed through but 11 years after it was introduced, the UNCRPD has still not been ratified
It is extraordinary that 156 countries have ratified the convention and Ireland is not one of them
I do not doubt the Minister of State's commitment to this issue-----
-----but it is taking a long time
I asked the Minister of State about it three or four times since I was elected
I understand the relevant Bill is on Committee Stage
Waiting for the ratification of the UNCRPD is becoming a latter-day "Waiting for Godot"
If there is a will in this House, things get done but if there is not a will, things do not get done
It is as simple as that
I will probably ask the Minister of State the question again in September or even next year
Hopefully, the convention will be ratified but one gets disillusioned very quickly in this place when one sees the things that happen
I am sure the Minister of State wants to see the convention ratified as much as anybody else but people with disabilities are looking to Members to ratify it
I do not think everything has to be in place
Let us ratify the convention and give people with disabilities an equal footing with able-bodied people

I commend Sinn Féin for this motion and, in particular, the contributions of Deputies Kathleen Funchion and Donnchadh Ó Laoghaire
A number of us were at a demonstration six weeks ago outside the gates of this House organised by SIPTU on a significant day - International Children's Day
Obviously, the protest was about child care and the poor pay and conditions that workers face
Not only are poor pay and conditions a problem in child care, but so too is staff retention
As other Deputies have said, it seems incredible that we have 22,000 people looking after our children who are very badly paid
There is something fundamentally wrong with that model
Ireland has one of the most expensive child care systems in the OECD
It is the most expensive with the least subsidies and a workforce that is badly paid
Obviously, there are parallels between what is going on in child care and the health care system
There is pay apartheid in the health care system
As Deputies have said, there is this mystical Nordic child care plan that we all aspire to
The nearest we get to Nordic child care in Ireland is if we go to IKEA and leave our children in the crèche there
The facts speak for themselves
In Ireland, we spend 0
5% of GDP
If one wants a Nordic child care system, one must spend 2% of GDP on child care
It is a lack of investment that has led to this debate on poor pay and conditions for staff
I think the Minister will admit that there is a genuine crisis in the child care system in this country
When I was investigating this and doing a bit of research, I found there is a bewildering array of child care schemes
I understand the Minister is trying to amalgamate them
There is the community childcare subvention programme, the after-school childcare scheme, the childcare education and training support programme and the early childhood care and education scheme
I welcome the fact the Minister is introducing a new scheme, a single affordable child care scheme with a universal subsidy, to replace the other schemes
I hope I am correct in that
Currently, we have over 4,000 child care service providers, between community and private for profit
I really welcome that this motion shines a light on those who look after our children
Obviously, they want to be as committed as possible to their work
We should aspire to the Nordic model
If we do not give subvention to child care, it will have a knock-on effect on the workers and also on the quality of child care
Child care is an invaluable form of looking after our children and society as a whole
Fianna Fáil caused the crisis
They have a hard neck
I raised this issue with the Taoiseach last week
I am raising it again to make a point about the high cost of medicines in this country
I think the Taoiseach is aware of the case of a lady called Charlotte Connolly from his time as Minister for Health a few years ago
Charlotte suffers from Degos disease, which is extremely rare
She is the only person with it in Ireland at the moment
I spoke to her husband Declan approximately an hour ago
He is in a very precarious position as Charlotte's husband
He wants to see the best for Charlotte, who was diagnosed with this illness three and a half years ago
Somebody who is diagnosed with Degos disease usually has a four-year limitation on his or her lifespan
Declan is extremely worried about his situation
The drug Charlotte is trying to access is called Soliris, made in Blanchardstown by Alexion, and it costs €400,000 per year, which is extraordinary
There was also a lot of publicity around Orkambi
Does the health committee review the price of drugs in this country? They are exorbitant
When the drugs are made in Ireland, those prices seem to be extortionate
I spoke about Charlotte Connolly's situation and I ask the Government to intervene
Charlotte is looking for a three-month trial of the drug in question
Other people with the same condition have taken it in the United States and have experienced huge health benefits
Charlotte was diagnosed three and a half years ago
If it was the Taoiseach's loved one in this scenario, he would do absolutely anything to extend his or her life and Charlotte just wants to have a go at life, which she deserves
As somebody who lives out in Blanchardstown, where this drug is made, can the Taoiseach make an exception so that Charlotte Connolly can have the chance she deserves?

The Government made a commitment on the high cost of medicines in the programme for Government to drive down the cost of drugs and medicines
The reason I raised this issue is because of a lady called Charlotte Connolly
I am not sure many people know her, but she is the only person in Ireland suffering from Degos disease
Her husband was here yesterday
He walked from Mullingar to Dáil Éireann to highlight Charlotte's situation
She wants access to a drug called Soliris on an experimental basis to treat her illness
At present the drug costs €400,000 per year per patient
It is made by a company in the Taoiseach's constituency, Alexion Pharmaceuticals
Will the Taoiseach give a commitment to give Charlotte access to the drug? The Minister for Health should meet the family to clarify the issue
I welcome this debate about the fair deal scheme
I agree with the merits of the motion in its entirety
It is imperative that we plan for generational demographic changes which will happen over the next 13 years
The population of over-75s is set to double
One of the hardest decisions anybody could make in his or her life is to send a loved one to a nursing home
That is a very traumatic and emotional time for the family and the person who is going into the nursing home
There is another narrative here that I would like to bring up about nursing homes generally and the privatisation of nursing homes
At present, 76% of all nursing homes are privately run
It is projected that in the next 20 years all long-term nursing homes will be completely privately run
This was facilitated by two ghosts of the past in this House, namely former Deputy Mary Harney and former Deputy Charlie McCreevy
Former Deputy Mary Harney was the instigator of the fair deal scheme in 2009, and I think its primary purpose was to ensure the privatisation of elderly care in Ireland
We had a debate last night about waiting lists
They are terrible
I stipulated that the reason why so much privatisation is seen in this country goes back to an Act which the Minister for Finance at that time, Charlie McCreevy, introduced, giving serious tax breaks for developers of private hospitals and private nursing care centres
We are living with that legacy today
It is estimated that since 2001 and 2002, those developers have been subsidised by €10 billion in the form of tax breaks in the subsequent years
All of this removes the duty of care from the State to the private developers
It is quite big business
For example, last year, the ten biggest companies that provide private health care in nursing homes got €53 million from the HSE from the fair deal scheme
We support the motion, but the narrative that I have is that this goes back to the privatisation of public health care
It may be a fair deal, but it is not a cheap deal
I am sharing time with Deputy Mick Barry
I support some of the observations and aspirations in this motion but, sadly, it is largely aspirational unless we have a fundamental policy change for health care in this country
As Deputy Nolan says, there is a human story behind every statistic in this motion
Some 660,000 people are on waiting lists
That is 660,000 individuals
The 100,000 outpatients are 100,000 individuals
We are sanitised to those human stories both inside and outside this Chamber
We can wax lyrical on what is going on with the health service, but there needs to be health service revolution, from the bottom to the top, and that has to be driven by front-line staff rather than HSE middle managers
Today we are talking about the long waiting times for people
There was a report on this in  One can include what is happening in Lynn Dara
Eleven beds have been closed in Lynn Dara for one reason only, because of the shortage of nursing staff
Nurses are leaving the health service
As I said to the Taoiseach last week, there is almost a two-tier pay system in the medical profession because health care workers in the public sector are being enticed by the private sector
The reason Linn Dara is closing down for three months with the loss of 11 beds is the shortage of staff
Nursing staff are looking at the public sector pay talks with an eye to their future
Numerous beds and theatres have closed down across the country
Health care workers are looking at the public health system and they see a sick system
I worked in the health care system for a long time
The majority of the time one has a very good experience in the public health care system, but when it comes to waiting times and waiting for beds, it is a sick system
The other statistic that stands out is that since 2008 and the crisis in this country, 3,500 nurses have been taken out of the public health system
That is a 9% reduction in nursing staff
Of course, one will have a perennial crisis
Also, the mental health care staff is 21% lower than recommended
Of course, one will have a crisis
My question to the Minister is simple
Does he believe in a universal health system? I do not know whether he does
On numerous occasions I have had this argument about the health service being ideologically run because of the two-tier system
Fianna Fáil's motion is hypocritical
In 2001, 2002 and 2003, the then Minister for Finance, Mr
Charlie McCreevy, was giving subsidies to builders to build a lot of private hospitals
We will continue to have this perennial problem
I am sure the Minister does not want this to be happening
We will have this crisis constantly unless we deal with the fundamental issue of the health service
The fundamental reason there is a crisis in the health service is that it is a two-tier health service
The privatisation of some public hospitals and the public system is causing the crisis
Sometimes it is not about money
Sometimes it is about staff and people
People make it a good health service
It is a good health service when one accesses it but waiting times for beds are not acceptable
When there is a system of universal health care, regardless of how much one has in one's pocket, we will have a system about which everybody will feel confident and proud
Until then, we will have crisis upon crisis
The issue of 11 beds being closed at Linn Dara in Cherry Orchard was raised in the Chamber yesterday
This is the tip of the iceberg when it comes to staff shortages
I want to list the theatres throughout the country where there have been closures because of staff shortages, as I believe this is a symptom of something else
Our Lady’s Children’s Hospital, Crumlin, had two full theatre closures over a six-week period due to staffing shortages, while Temple Street Children’s University Hospital had one theatre closure for the same reason
Theatre closures were reported in all constituent hospitals at the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group
At St
James’s Hospital, there were two to three theatres closed per day, depending on nursing shortages on the rota
In St
Luke’s Hospital, Kilkenny, an elective theatre closed because of staffing shortages
A new theatre had not opened in Wexford General Hospital due to the difficulty in securing specialty theatre nursing staff
This is a symptom of something much bigger, and that something bigger is pay and conditions for nurses
I want to move on to something equally crucial which nobody has picked up on in the Chamber this week
A report in There were 2,520 children and young people on waiting lists for an initial assessment for mental health services in February 2017, an increase of 44 per cent on the same period last year, according to the HSE
Barnardos has said these delays are having “long-term unnecessary consequences” on children and “affecting every aspect of their development”
It found almost 60 per cent have been waiting for more than a year while a quarter (26 per cent) have been waiting more than two years for an initial appointment
I find this incredible
The reason Linn Dara has a shortage of nurses is that nurses are emigrating for better pay and conditions
The past year has seen systematic cuts to their conditions and pay
We are living not only with a two-tier health system but a two-tier pay system, whereby nurses and medical professionals are going to the private sector rather than the public sector
The mantra of Fine Gael over the past six years has been to create the conditions for growth and prosperity
However, the Taoiseach and his party have created the conditions for this crisis
Fundamentally, I think the Taoiseach is a very decent man, but how can he, after six years, turn around, hold his head high and say that, in his tenure as Taoiseach, this was a success?I would actually find that embarrassing as a member of the party he is in and as a citizen of this country
How can the Taoiseach justify those cuts and that shortage in this country?
While that all sounds well and good, there seems to be a perennial problem and we go from crisis to crisis in the health service
It is not rocket science
In a country where there is a lot of money sloshing around, we should have a health system that works for everybody, regardless of whether they are millionaires or unemployed
That is how it should work
Nobody should have to wait two years for any sort of assessment
It is a disgrace
The closures at the Linn Dara facility and elsewhere come down to not paying nurses properly
The past seven or eight years have taken their toll on nurses and other public sector workers
They are demoralised and have to work an extra hour per week just to make ends meet
This is the fundamental problem
On Friday at 4 o'clock in Cherry Orchard there will be a protest over the cutbacks
There is another point about public sector pay
I do not want to make it personal because I try to differentiate between the personal and political
However, the Taoiseach is going to walk away with a massive pension in two weeks' time
He will get a golden handshake and a pension of €150,000
Most people listening to these proceedings will be nauseated when they hear that
That is the two-tier system we have in this country, where politicians go off into the sunshine with golden handshakes and big money
Is the Taoiseach not ashamed of what he has left behind?
People are waiting two years for simple assessments
I know that
I have previously raised on a number occasions in this format the status of a Bill which I put forward last year, namely, the Medicinal Cannabis Bill
Thankfully, on 1 December the Bill received cross-party support in the Dáil
Since then the Bill has completed the pre-legislative scrutiny process and it is now with the Parliamentary Legal Adviser
I understand this stuff - scrutiny and so on - has to take place
However, there is no doubt in my mind that the Committee on Health is trying to frustrate passage of this Bill
I have no doubt that that is going to happen despite that Vera Twomey and many others could benefit from its enactment
Will the Taoiseach put pressure on the Committee on Health to bring the Bill forward to Committee Stage?
I welcome the motion brought forward by the Independents 4 Change in regard to the operations of Caranua
I knew little about this organisation up to six months ago
I now have a lot of information about it, including in relation to the recent briefing
In my view, Caranua is not fit for purpose at this point in time
The survivors for whom the organisation was set up to assist have been met with belligerence and confusion in terms of its operations
Caranua was set up to financially compensate survivors for the grotesque violence meted out to them at a particular time and to give them justice but in my view, it is being run like a business
The inner workings not of Caranua but the board are bizarre
As stated by Deputy Funchion, the CEO of Caranua made an extraordinary statement recently that was very demeaning
While she has since retracted that statement, it is indicative of the inner workings of Caranua
The survivors were systematically abused in the past and are now trying to get justice
Hopefully they will get it
I welcome this debate, which throws up many questions about the organisation
Hopefully, people will get some sort of justice, as well as clarity on Caranua
The question is to ask the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice and Equality if she will commission a public inquiry into the death of Shane O'Farrell, and if she will make a statement on the matter
I will cut straight to the chase
I do not understand it
This August will bring the sixth anniversary of Shane O'Farrell's untimely and, in my opinion, preventable, death
That is the opinion of many others as well
The O'Farrell family have been seeking justice and solace
Not only have the police, the prosecutor and the Director of Public Prosecutions failed the family but the Minister has failed them badly as well
Incredibly, the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission investigation has been going on since January 2012, that is to say, for five and a half years
It is appalling
The family and many other people, including people in this House, are calling for a public inquiry
No investigation takes five and a half years
The level of delay is appalling
This brings in the wider narrative of the crisis of confidence in the police service of this country
Many people have lost confidence in the force
I put this to the Tánaiste last December
I cannot make it any clearer
I am calling on the Tánaiste to call for a public inquiry into this man's death
It has been five and a half years
I have lost all confidence in this process
I understand there must be due process but I have lost confidence, not only in the process but in the ability of the Tánaiste to investigate this
It is clear that Shane O'Farrell would have been here today with his family were it not for the incompetence of the police service of this country
That goes without a doubt
What his family is seeking is simple
Shane cannot come back, unfortunately, but they are seeking justice
It is a simple thing the Tánaiste can propel
The old saying is that justice delayed is justice denied
Justice is being denied not only to Shane and his family but to the Members of this Parliament
It is disgraceful that five and a half years after the beginning of the GSOC investigation it is still in logjam
The Tánaiste should give the family a public inquiry and allow the country to seek justice
It is up to the Tánaiste to say today clearly that she will give this family a public inquiry
The family say it was stuck in GSOC
That is a fantasy and a joke

I will cut to the chase in this debate
This crisis is manufactured
It has been in the mists for the last seven or eight years
It is a crisis that has been caused by politicians like the Minister of State - I do not mean that personally - and his party colleagues, as well as members of Fianna Fáil looking the other way
It is a crisis that has brought untold misery to thousands of people
It is ideologically driven by the worst forms of neoliberalism, which commodifies housing
Nowadays, most people refer to housing as property but housing is a home, in my eyes
There are so many examples of families and working people who are in absolute crisis and who have nowhere to go
At the same time, some have made serious profits from this crisis
I want to draw attention to two companies in particular
I had not heard of them until a few weeks ago when I started doing some research for this debate
The companies in question have lovely names but they are actually ruthless
The first is a company called I-RES, a real estate investment trust
This company generated a pre-tax profit of €30 million last year, up from €7
9 million in 2014, on the back of strong rental growth and high occupancy levels
The group said that it had net assets worth €435 million at the end of December
The other company is called Green REIT, which recorded a 10% increase in contracted annual rent this year, to €61
3 million from 21 properties
Its net asset value rose by €148 million
These companies were set up to avail of very generous tax laws introduced by the current Minister for Finance which enable international investors to capitalise by buying properties which were sold very cheaply by the State and then renting them out for astronomical amounts
That is very unjust
I am from Dublin Mid-West, the same constituency as Deputy Ó Broin
When I was a councillor, the issue that always dominated was housing
I hear stories all the time from people who phone or call into my office but nothing shocks me anymore, such is the extent of the housing crisis in this country
I have spoken to people who have been on the housing waiting list for ten to 12 years and who have run out of options, both physically as well as mentally
Their situation is doing terrible things to their minds and to the lives of their children and it is ruining their social lives
There is a litany of horrible things going on Ireland at the moment
People are being forced to live in hotels or in totally overcrowded conditions
They are living in appalling circumstances that are not of their making but are of the Government's making
This is ideologically driven
The housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme is simply not working, according to the vast majority of people who have contacted my office
I heard of a case recently where a family has been given homeless HAP up to the tune of €1,900 for a two-bedroom unit
This is leading to a situation where vulture funds and unscrupulous landlords are increasing rents further, in the face of the unnatural level of demand
There is a huge crisis out there and this Bill, which is not perfect by any means, is an attempt to address the horrendous situation for those in need of social housing, as well as those who simply want to rent and get on with their lives
At the moment, some people are spending up to 70% of their income on rent and that is not acceptable
I was born and grew up in a housing estate in Neilstown and am very proud of where I am from
That housing estate was not without its problems at the beginning but it has grown into a very mature and good place to live
It is predominantly an area of social housing
I suggest 95% of houses in the area are social housing
I take exception to anybody inside or outside this House suggesting we cannot have 100% social housing anymore because it would lead to social problems
It is absolute rubbish to use such language
When people are given good housing, infrastructure and transport links, they will grow with their communities and become good citizens
The ideology or policy of the Government and its predecessor has been that there must be mixed-tenure dwellings and projects, which is fair enough
I understand there must be mixed tenure
However, the vast majority of projects are now so diluted that they have less than 20% social housing
If this continues, we are going to keep coming back to the same problem, which is that people cannot be housed in the State
I have many problems with Fianna Fáil, but at least it housed people in the 1950s and the 1960s at a time when the country had nothing
People were housed in great areas of Dublin like Drimnagh and Ballyfermot at a time when the country had very little
It is now extremely wealthy, but it cannot house its citizens, which is an absolute shame
While the Bill is not perfect, at least it tries to deal with some aspects of the ongoing crisis
Will the Minister consider supporting the Banded Hours Contract Bill 2016 currently undergoing scrutiny on Committee Stage rather than introducing a draft proposal of her own?
I am slightly puzzled as to why Fine Gael opposes the Sinn Féin Banded Hours Contract Bill 2016
What the Minister has said is that a similar proposal is being drafted currently
In the era of new politics - much is made of that around here - this is old politics
It is actually quite cynical
I understand that the Bill is going through pre-legislative scrutiny currently
However, it is being grounded by the vested interests of the employers' groups
Where I am from, there are a lot of people on low pay and doing very insecure work
It is imperative that a Bill copperfastens workers' rights, particularly in the low-pay sector
It is up to the Minister of State to support Deputy Cullinane's Bill
It is quite a good Bill, though in some ways it does not go far enough
It is imperative that the Government works with parties that it normally disagrees with in the age of new politics
I will study the Bill when it comes out
I ask the Minister of State not to take offence to this, but Fine Gael does not have a great track record on workers' rights in this country - far from it
The Minister of State should acknowledge that there are a lot of workers in this country who are extremely exploited and a lot of companies that are making vast profits from workers' labour
They are very vulnerable at the moment
Anything that copperfastens workers' rights will be welcomed
In the era of new politics, I believe Deputy Cullinane's Bill should be supported and not ground down

This is a worthwhile debate to address religious discrimination in State schools
The subtext to the debate is the power of the Catholic Church and its iron grip on society
Thankfully, that grip has been dramatically loosened over the past 20 years, but it needs to be loosened much further
I was brought up a Catholic but I am not a Catholic anymore
A majority of our people probably still recognise themselves as a Catholic but no Catholic could ever defend what the Catholic Church did to this country, including committing some of the most despicable acts against people
I would like to highlight a relevant case relating to school admissions
I was contacted by a family from Dublin earlier to highlight the situation they are facing, which is incredible
They live next door to a primary school but their child cannot go to the school because he is not Catholic
I will quote the reasons the child cannot get a place in the school under the heading, "Procedures for offering places":In the event of there being more applicants than places available, the following criteria will apply:1
Sisters and brothers of children who are currently enrolled in the school
Catholic children who are resident within the parish boundary of Our Lady of the Rosary, Harold's Cross, Dublin 6
Children who attended the Montessori facility
Catholic children resident in the parish of Mount Argus
Children of other faiths and non-resident in the parishes of Harold's Cross and Mount Argus in that order
The order in which names are recorded in the registration book
The child qualifies under the fifth procedure
As a young child, he cannot go to a school of his peers in his neighbourhood
The family of that child is paying tax, which funds that school, and it is incredible that he cannot go to the school because he is not a Catholic
If that child was a different colour - if he was black - it would be discrimination
I find it incredible that in the 21st century, this sort of thing can go on
Members eulogise about the Constitution in this Dáil and its righteousness
The Constitution says to treat all children equally, but those words are very hollow when it comes to this child
I wish to ask the Taoiseach about proposed legislation on the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, because a number of people have raised this issue numerous times since I have been here
From looking at the statistics it is almost a national embarrassment
A total of 156 countries have ratified the convention
Ireland signed the convention in 2006 but it is the only country in the EU not to have ratified it
People are asking, as are many Deputies, why Ireland has not ratified it
I know this is being dealt with on Committee Stage under the Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill but surely the convention can be ratified
From my experience here, I have learned that democracy works extremely slowly
Surely we have to give the 300,000 people with disabilities who are waiting for the convention to be ratified an answer before the summer recess
This could go on forever
It was 11 years ago
I thank the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade for taking this issue
As he might know, 1,500 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails are on hunger strike
The strike is in its 23rd day and has been named "Freedom and Dignity"
The prisoners are only accepting water and salt to sustain themselves
The reason why the prisoners are on strike is the continuing brutalisation of Palestinian prisoners in Israel
I include 300 children who are not on hunger strike but who are in the prison population
I will read out the demands of the hunger strikers because they are crucial to understanding why the prisoners are on hunger strike
They include an end to the denial of family visits, the right to pursue higher education while in prison, appropriate medical care and treatment and an end to solitary confinement and detention and imprisonment without charge or trial
The prisoners are subjected to solitary confinement, torture, medical negligence, abuse, withdrawal of phone calls to their family members and violations of their basic human rights
Over the past 23 days, some of the prisoners have been moved to other jails by the Israeli authorities, which is highly suspect
The Israeli Government has even stated that it is willing to force feed some of the prisoners, which I find unbelievable
I thought this was probably an exaggerated statement but apparently it happened in the 1980s with other Palestinian prisoners on hunger strike in Israeli jails
One of the prisoners' leaders, Marwan Barghouti, has been in solitary confinement for the past 23 days, which is quite outrageous
The Israeli Government has refused to negotiate with the prisoners on their demands and refers to the prisoners as terrorists
I would refer to them as political prisoners
There is growing international solidarity with and support for the prisoners
In general, Ireland has a very good record of showing support for Palestinian rights and statehood
We had a similar situation in the early 1980s with hunger strikers in Northern Ireland so we know what people have to do to demand their rights and the extremes to which they will go to highlight their issue
I am asking the Minister to highlight this issue and summon the Israeli ambassador and tell him to negotiate with the prisoners because it is only a matter of time before some prisoners die
The Minister should take sides because these are not ordinary prisoners
Most of them have been incarcerated against their will
As the Minister stated, 300 children, who are not part of the hunger strike, are in Israeli prisons
Palestinian prisoners are subjected to the most inhumane treatment Israel can mete out
If it mirrors what Israel does on a larger scale - how it treats Palestinians in the West Bank, Gaza and Israel - it is a terrible reflection on the state of Israel
It is important for the Minister to contact the Israeli ambassador and state that he is extremely worried about the ongoing issue of political prisoners in Israel
It is very important that he relays that message
Only recently, it was reported in the news that Ireland bought military drones from the Israeli military
I find it extraordinary that the Irish Government buys military hardware from a country with an appalling human rights record - a horrendous, obnoxious, racist state such as Israel
The Minister says he is not going to take sides
That is the problem
He needs to take a side
He needs to see that an oppressor is oppressing the Palestinian people
These men are on hunger strike to highlight that they are being brutalised in Israeli jails
I would do the same as them
Out of solidarity not only with Palestinian prisoners but also the Palestinian people, we should tell the Israeli ambassador that this situation needs to be dealt with before people die
What did he say?

What did he say?
I wish to read out a statement from the recent IMO annual conference
This has relevance to a Bill I introduced six months ago, the Cannabis for Medicinal Use Regulation Bill
It is very relevant
The motion stated:The IMO urges the Government not to limit the availability of medicinal cannabis products in any future legislation by restricting their prescription to consultants or the indications for which they can be prescribed, with such indications being informed by the evidence base
Ten days ago I accompanied Vera Twomey on a trip to Barcelona to obtain medicinal cannabis for her daughter
On arrival at Dublin Airport, that medicine was taken from her even though she had a prescription
I would say that medicine was taken from her illegally and she wants it back for the health of her daughter
I appeal to the Taoiseach as a person and not as a politician
It is imperative that my Bill is given a date by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health
Every week I get phone calls from people in pain who are not criminals, but are being treated like criminals
I ask the Taoiseach to give a date and give some hope to these people
They should not be treated like criminals but like citizens of this country trying to obtain medicinal cannabis
If the Taoiseach could give a date, it would be a really good legacy on his part
The Bill would make it through committee
I welcome those in the Gallery; it is good to see them
I welcome Deputy Browne's Bill, which shines a light on mental health services in Ireland
There has been a lot of discussion about mental health services and the accessibility difficulties
I was elected over a year ago
It is very healthy that we are having a grown-up debate about mental health
It is a sign that the stigma is in some ways being broken down
Things are not perfect by any means but sometimes talking about a problem halves it in some ways
Anything that strengthens patient advocacy and care is paramount in the health care environment
The advocacy for inpatients taking decisions about their treatment is a progressive and welcome change
The definition of a "voluntary patient", in terms of having capacity to consent to admission to hospital, in the Bill is welcome
It is not clear under the 2001 Act that consent to treatment is required from voluntary and involuntary patients
Replacing the existing principle of best interest under the 2001 Act with assisted decision-making empowers people to be decision-makers in their care
The Mental Health Act 2001 needs to be amended and is clearly not compliant with the European Convention on Human Rights or the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities
The Government's mental health policy, A Vision for Change, is now ten years old and is out of date in terms of its framework
It is yet to be fully implemented in terms of staffing and funding for mental health services
Resources need to be put where they are needed
People might not want to hear this but the lack of resources for essential services such as mental health is killing people in this country
If resources are not put where they are needed, people will die unnecessarily
All of us in this country are affected by mental health issues either personally or through family members
We all face the possibility of developing mental health difficulties
I would like to think that if I needed services they would be available but if they were not, I could have a completely different outcome
That is not acceptable in the 21st century
It is important to go beyond party politics
If one thing comes out of new politics, all of which I do not know that I buy into, it should be people working together for the greater good, better mental health services and in the service of the citizens of the country
That is very important
I welcome Deputy Browne's Bill
While it is not by any means perfect, nothing in life is so let us work together for a better outcome for everybody because anyone could be in that position
Let us send the message today that nobody is alone and that people who need help should seek it
If it is not there, that is a crime
I move amendment No
2:To delete all words after “Dáil Éireann” and substitute the following:“notes that:— 937,000 breath tests that never occurred were falsely recorded on the Police Using Leading Systems Effectively (PULSE) system, and that the existence of a problem in this regard was communicated to the Garda Commissioner, Nóirín O’Sullivan in 2014;— there were 146,865 District Court summonses for road traffic offences wrongly issued and that as a result 14,700 people were subject to wrongful convictions due to shameful Garda error and were never informed of the error, nor received an apology directly from An Garda Síochána;— the Garda Commissioner was notified of discrepancies in Garda breath test data by the Medical Bureau of Road Safety in 2014 but did not inform the public or the Policing Authority of these discrepancies until 23rd March, 2017;— the Garda Commissioner has accepted that An Garda Síochána recorded numbers that were false, and believes that this falsification may not be confined to traffic data;— the Garda Commissioner failed adequately to explain the cause of these errors;— high-ranking members of An Garda Síochána, including the Garda Commissioner, have recently been accused of engaging in a systematic campaign to smear the character and reputation of Sergeant Maurice McCabe and other Garda whistleblowers; and— there has been an erosion of public confidence and trust in An Garda Síochána including a lack of public confidence in the Garda Commissioner and senior Garda management to investigate possible Garda malpractice or corruption;acknowledges that:— An Garda Síochána should be held accountable in terms of their adherence to professional and ethical standards;— section 11 of the Garda Síochána Act 2005 states that:— a person who holds the office of Garda Commissioner may be removed from office by the Government but only for stated reasons, including:— the person has failed to perform the functions of the office with due diligence and effectiveness; and— the person’s removal from office would, in the Government’s opinion, be in the best interests of An Garda Síochána;— on notifying under section 12 (1) a person who holds the office of Garda Commissioner that the Government intends to consider removing him or her from office, the Government may immediately suspend the person from duty; and— section 12(1)(b) of the Garda Síochána Act 2005 further allows that the Government shall give the person an opportunity to make representations as to why he or she ought not to be removed from office; further notes that Garda Commissioner Nóirín O’Sullivan has stated that she plans to continue in her position even if there is a Dáil vote of no confidence in her; andcalls on the Government to:— immediately use the powers available to them under the Garda Síochána Act 2005 to notify Garda Commissioner Nóirín O’Sullivan that they intend to consider removing her and to suspend her from duty while she receives an opportunity to make representations as to why she ought not to be removed from office;— independently investigate the involvement of members of senior Garda management in malpractice, corruption and/or the harassment or smearing of whistleblowers;— urgently review the situations in which people may be convicted for certain crimes on the word of a Garda Superintendent; and— urgently review how An Garda Síochána can be made democratically accountable to the communities they serve, including the election of democratically accountable bodies empowered to decide on how policing is implemented, how policing resources are spent, and to hold An Garda Síochána accountable for their actions
I think the Minister might have good news
I was looking at his Twitter account
We will see in a few minutes
Hopefully it is good news for the many people who have been waiting for an end to this long drawn-out saga
Hopefully weeks will turn to minutes now
As Deputy Collins said, there is a young mother, Hazel Robinson, outside the Dáil at this moment
She has been sleeping there for the last three days
She is campaigning for her own daughter, Gypsy Anne
This makes us reflect on why people go to such desperate measures to highlight such desperate situations
It is terrible that people have to resort to such things
I hope the Minister will have some good news today in this regard
I realise talks are ongoing with Vertex Pharmaceuticals and the HSE over a proper price structure for Orkambi
I hope the Minister can give a commitment today to the effect that the people who could benefit greatly from this drug can get good news
That would enable them to get on with their lives
If we could start to administrate that, it could help a great many people
It is down to the Minister
It is good news
There are not many occasions when we hear such news
Sometimes in this House there is good news but most of the time it is bad news
It is good news for the people who are listening, especially the CF sufferers
This lengthy saga has been dragged out
If there is one lesson that everyone should learn, especially the Government and the HSE, it is that this should never happen again
This has been a drawn-out painful process for those who need essential drugs
It must not happen again
At the crux was the question of drug companies holding governments to hostage
Ultimately, it was about price
We cannot put a price on a person's life or health
That goes across the board
I hope the lesson is learned
Can the Minister comment on the price structure of Orkambi? A figure of €159,000 per year is completely unsustainable
I hope the price can be reconfigured

I wish to remark on two comments that were made over the weekend, one by Michael O'Leary, the enemy of the working class, and the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Varadkar
The Minister basically stated that the company should fold
That is the Government's ideology
Michael O'Leary praised the Minister, Deputy Ross, for not intervening
This man is the prince of darkness to me
He is the enemy of the working class
The Government's ideology is to privatise a public service
The House debates rural Ireland and its decline
This is a good public service in rural Ireland that the Government is removing
That is more detrimental than anything else in the world
The Minister must step forward and resolve the strike
I want to state some facts that get to the nub of this dispute
The Belgian Government pays 78% towards the PSO as it is known in Ireland
The equivalent figure is 51% in Switzerland, 49% in Holland and 12% in Ireland, which is in last place
The underfunding of a public service like Bus Éireann was destined to end in a crisis
This crisis is not confined to Bus Éireann
We also need to look at what will happen in Dublin Bus over the next year when 10% of its routes are opened to private operators
The exact same thing that is happening to Bus Éireann workers will happen to Dublin Bus workers
This is an ideological assault on public transport in Ireland
It is time for the Minister to get his finger out

I will quote extensively from what the Minister said to reiterate what he said recently about MABS and CIS
He stated:
there will be no job losses, no closure of services, no change to service delivery locations and no change to the terms and conditions of serving staff during the lifetime of the restructuring programme
There will be no disruption to CIB and MABS services for those who use them
He went on to say: The decision comes after a lengthy and extensive analysis of options and detailed consultation period with all stakeholders on the need for a streamlined governance model
The decision taken will simply reduce the number of individual local CIS and MABS companies boards from 93 to 16
A new regional board structure will be put in place which will comprise eight CIS boards and eight MABS boards
When I hear a Fine Gael Minister say there will be no cuts to services and that we are simply streamlining the governance model, I get very nervous
I have seen how streamlining services has impacted on citizens in the place where I live since the start of the recession and we are still trying to pick up the pieces
For many of the constituents hit by the recession, negative equity, the threat of eviction or homelessness, and especially the decisions made by the Department of Social Protection in terms of its private arms such as JobPath, both MABS and the CIS have proven literally to be life-savers
I have dealt with countless constituents who found the advice and, more importantly, the advocacy of these services to be their best hope in the past seven to eight years of austerity
Therefore, anything which impacts on them is a massive issue for the most vulnerable and poorest in society
The point has been made, but perhaps the Minister does not understand it, that if the local boards which provide the service are altered, changed or streamlined, it will change the type of service that is provided
It will undermine the voluntary and local participation in the service
This service grew up organically in the communities that it serves because people need help accessing State services to get their entitlements
Crucially, it will undermine the vital advocacy role that the service provides
The Minister told us that no changes are envisaged in this programme but already we find that what were permanent and full-time staff contracts are increasingly becoming short and fixed-term contracts for eight months to two years
I also point out that the CIS, in a report it commissioned, refers to the need to keep the Department of Social Protection satisfied and the fact that the Department sees the present structure as unwieldy
Is it the Minister and his Department that are pushing these proposed changes? I remind the House that for many vulnerable people on the receiving end of decisions by the State and its institutions, these services are their only lifeline
Their present structure has given many vulnerable people a voice and an advocate in dealing with appeals of the Minister's Department - for example, finding out what they might be entitled to in certain circumstances
This is not just about providing information for online services, but is also an excellent way of keeping people up to date
I fear that in all the talk of streamlining and governance, the key advocacy role of these services will be diluted and, ironically, this will have a massive impact on those who need them most, such as those facing evictions and those on the receiving end of decisions of the Minister's Department
There are more than 1,000 volunteers who work in these services and whose contribution is now in danger of being ignored and downgraded in these proposed changes
This cannot be allowed to happen
The proposed regionalisation of the service will not improve it
It will not deal with the issues that confront staff and service users or the crying need for those services
We need to fund and value services properly
These changes cannot proceed
The community and volunteers who rely on and provide these services must be consulted and involved in the changes
I welcome this progressive Bill
Anything that prevents deaths and promotes harm reduction in this city is very good
Supervised injecting rooms give people access to treatment, take people off the streets and give them alternative means of gaining access to the drug they take
In addition, they reduce the number of overdoses
I have seen the social damage that heroin has done to the community I lived in
I saw friends of mine die from heroin abuse
I saw at first hand the absolute tragedy of what heroin does to communities
The Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, will appreciate that herself
In the area she represents, she will have seen the absolutely appalling damage drugs have done to people
Nobody on this earth grows up wanting to be a heroin addict
It is not of their choosing; it is because of circumstances
We all make mistakes, and sometimes those mistakes are fatal
It is very good that we are having a debate in this country on the decriminalisation and liberalisation of drug use
We are getting there
It is very important to have the discussion
A number of Deputies will agree that this issue is more about treating people holistically and according to a health-based approach rather than treating them as criminals
Would we lock up a chronic alcoholic in a prison? We would not
We would give him or her treatment and try to give him or her a plan to move beyond the circle of chronic abuse
I hope a day will come when a chronic abuser of heroin or another drug will be able to bypass the criminal justice system and be treated according to an holistic, health-based approach
That is very important
References to the Portuguese model are bandied about a lot
This is important because if we can save one life, it will have been well worth the effort
I was in Portugal last year and asked many people about how the system works for people there
If a person is caught in possession of a certain amount of drugs there, he or she is not criminalised but given an alternative
The war on drugs has been an abject failure
We must consider completely different approaches
Some of these will be extremely hard for people to understand and some of them will be very radical
I believe those in possession of a small amount of drugs for their own use should not be criminalised
Rather, they should be offered another path
People injecting heroin in this city and others should be given an alternative
Under the supervision of doctors, they can stay away from the street environment
I welcome this approach
There were 687 rehabilitation beds and 144 detox beds in Ireland, but over the past eight or nine years, those numbers were vastly reduced because of austerity
Everyone knows that people who are coming off heroin or any other drugs must go through detox
Otherwise, they will go through a full circle of misery
I have friends who have gone through both systems
Some of them have come out the other end but for others it is a constant battle
Nobody was born to take the worst drug of all, heroin, with the misery and social damage that it causes
Nobody chooses that path
People just take the wrong path in life
This legislation is progressive
It will give people an alternative and it is to be hoped we will see it being implemented in the next six months or so
If it can save one life, then it is well worth it
Thank you
I acknowledge Vera and Paul Twomey, who are in the Public Gallery
Vera and Paul have been with me for the past nine days, walking from Cork to Dublin to raise awareness of-----
Yes, to raise the plight of their daughter
We had a four and a half hour meeting yesterday with the Minister for Health, quite a long, arduous meeting after a long walk
I want the Taoiseach to commit to what the Minister said, which was witnessed by Deputy Micheál Martin and a number of other Deputies, that is, that the medicinal cannabis Bill I introduced plus any relevant statutory instrument will be legislated for in a 12-week timeframe
I ask him to give this commitment because not only is Vera's family-----

Hopefully the Minister has good news or some clarity on the issue
Currently, Lucan community college is included in the Department of Education and Skills construction programme 2012 to 2016
The extension has been blighted by delays over the last ten years
There are many young people in Lucan
It has a large, growing school population
There is temporary accommodation on the campus currently to accommodate the overflow of students
I understand, because I got a lot of correspondence in the last week about this, that it is at stage 2A of the architectural planning process
That target was meant to be for completion of the extension in 2018
Now that is not going to be met
They have said that this needs to go to stage 2B, which could have the completion date of September 2019
That is still a long time away
Even that could run into difficulty
I am trying to get clarity as to whether this could be fast-tracked or if clarity could be given to the college and the parents of students in the vicinity, because there is a huge need for this college
The college is about 30 years old
It needs to be updated
I ask the Minister to give clarity on when this can be finalised and completed
I thank the Minister for that technical reply
Can the Minister give a completion date to try to decipher this? These things can go forever
Can the Minister give a completion date saying that it should be completed by September 2019? Obviously, the correspondence I got from some of the parents asked if the completion of stage 2A could be expedited with approval to stage 2B granted as a matter of urgency
I do not know if the Minister addressed that in the reply
Basically the students and parents are looking for a completion date that the school can plan for
I do not know if the Minister can supply that
I know these are technical things
This seems to have really dragged on to a point where figures can be a bit elusive
I ask for some sort of completion date
Hopefully the Minister has good news or some clarity on the issue

Will the Minister for Social Protection report on the findings of the SILC report and make changes to the one-parent family payment as a result of those findings?
I have raised this issue numerous times with the Minister and I do not think he is for turning
The finding of the EU SILC report is quite explicit
One parent households in Ireland have suffered immeasurably
Two points in particular are damning for this country and previous Governments
In 2008 consistent poverty for lone parents was 17
In 2015, that shot up to 26
The latter was compounded by budgets from the Minister’s Government between 2012 and 2014 which took 3
5 times more from the bottom 40% of the population than from the top 30%
This is ideological warfare by the Minister’s party and Fianna Fáil
I want the Minister to comment on that
Fianna Fáil caused so much damage it has serious questions to answer
It has serious questions to answer
I am asking the Minister to comment on the-----
The Deputy's party bankrupted the country
He even has a nerve to come back here
Fianna Fáil bankrupted the country
Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil are the same
I know the Minister likes spouting facts and he is selective but I will give him a fact that there is no denying: in 2015, two years ago, the richest 300 individuals in this country increased their wealth from €50 billion to €85 billion while lone parents suffered a cut of 18% in their very small incomes
If that is not ideological warfare, I do not know what is
The Minister and his party stand for that and the same is true of Fianna Fáil
Even today, the Children's Rights Alliance has given the Government a D grade in respect of children's rights
This Government is failing children
It is failing working people
It is particularly failing lone parents who have been discriminated against for the past seven or eight years, particularly by Fianna Fail and the Labour Party, unfortunately
Deputy Burton has a lot to answer for
These are facts
Facts
They are facts
They are poor

I propose to raise an issue I have raised many times in recent weeks and comment on the report of the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, published last Friday
The HPRA report is flawed and does not go nearly far enough
Will the Taoiseach indicate when the Bill we introduced on 1 December 2016 will come before the Select Committee on Health? It should be taken within 12 weeks
On a serious related matter, Deputy Harty made comments over the weekend which prejudiced the Bill proposed by People Before Profit
The Deputy stated that the Bill is no longer needed
I have asked him for clarification but he has not provided it
His role as chairperson of the Joint Committee on Health is untenable
He has shown disrespect to me, my party comrades and the people in the Public Gallery on 1 December last
I ask him to comment
I also ask the Taoiseach to provide a precise date for the taking of the Bill in committee
Last week, I raised the crisis regarding hospital trolleys and the health service with the Minister
I want to differentiate between the personal and political
Sometimes we have to do that in this game
This is not a perennial problem
Rather, it is a systematic problem with our health service
Unfortunately, our health service is quite sick
The reason for this is neglect
The reason the health service has been neglected is because, in the past eight years, the Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil parties have made political choices that have resulted in the health service being in a state of constant crisis
It does not have to be like this
The "RTE Investigates" programme broadcast on Monday night was horrendous
It was an embarrassment to be a Member of this Parliament watching people suffer needlessly
While the programme is imprinted on our minds, it will be largely forgotten
What will not be forgotten is the reality of what people have to face
Statistics relating to the health service make for difficult reading for the Minister and for any Member who wants a decent society
In January, at the height of the problem, 612 people were on hospital trolleys
Yesterday, over 500 people were on hospital trolleys
According to the European health consumer index, Ireland has the longest waiting times for CT scans and minor operations and is the worst of 36 countries for ease of access to health care
Since 2008, due to Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, 1,600 beds were lost in the health service
Health staff are overworked, underpaid and constantly battling with staff shortages, while morale has hit rock bottom
Patients wait years for surgery, as was seen on the recent RTE programme
This is absolutely unacceptable in 21st century Ireland
It is the same for waiting times for speech and language therapy, occupational therapy and physical therapy
The list goes on
This is because of the two-tier health system
The NTPF just sells public patients to the private sector
It does not go any way in trying to address the fundamental issues in our health service
There is obviously something wrong
The Minister stated €14
5 billion is spent annually on the health service, a significant amount of money
According to the OECD, Ireland spends the third most on health services in the OECD
Why can we not get it right? The onus is on the Minister's party to address these issues
I am not blaming the Minister but it is up to him to address these issues
Ultimately, what we want to see is a universal health care system that is not a two-tier system in which a person with money can jump the queue
In a civilised society, which we all live in, it should not be the case
It should be universal, funded through central taxation, where people on the point of care should get access to health care not because of the depth of their pockets
Waiting times are an absolute scandal in this country
I am asking the Minister to put his reputation on the line and say, like previous Ministers, the trolley crisis and waiting times are absolutely unacceptable and to give a commitment that if the same thing happens this time next year, he will resign
I raised this issue last week with the Taoiseach but he did not get back to me so I will raise it again
It relates to the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, policy review of medicinal cannabis
I spoke to the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, who said he would try to make it public this week
It is of the utmost importance that this review be made public as soon as possible
The Minister said he would act immediately once he got the report
There are many families who will be affected by this
I ask the Minister for Health whether, given the record number of acutely ill people who are waiting on trolleys in emergency departments in January this year and the threat of strike action by nurses due to unsafe staffing levels, he will allocate emergency funding of €1
2 million to address this problem urgently
This is not a perennial problem; it runs much deeper than the yearly crisis that is generated
I want to differentiate between the political and the personal, because that is important
I am sure the Minister and everybody else in the House does not want to see anybody on a trolley, but it happens
At one stage this year, 600 people were on trolleys
They are ordinary people who paid taxes and try to live a good life, but are sick and sought help from the Irish health service
It is an embarrassment, as a citizen of the country, to see people on trolleys waiting for basic health services
I said I do not want to be personal, but rather political
The Fine Gael Party has been in government for the past six years and has had two previous Ministers for Health who failed abjectly
The Minister should be embarrassed to be a part of Fine Gael, a party that has let down many people in the country who paid tax and yet have to suffer
I hope next year and the year after the Minister will be able to say there are no patients waiting on trolleys
The situation is very serious
Let us get down to the facts
This problem is also the fault of Fianna Fáil
Some 1,600 beds have been taken out of the Irish health service over the past nine years
Of course that would result in a crisis
Worse than that is the morale of the accident and emergency staff, who are the best trained and motivated staff in the European Union
They are well qualified, but are demoralised by cuts in the health service and seeing people who could be their brothers and sisters on trolleys
The Minister has the power to solve this issue
It is not rocket science
There is a solution to every problem
The solution to this problem is to provide more beds
The Minister should stake his claim and say there will be no trolleys on corridors in the next 18 months
If he can do that, he will go down in history

Deputy Burton has robbed all my lines
I would be interested in the Minister of State's view on the sale of Luggala estate
I probably go to Wicklow once a week
The backdrop with that road coming into Luggala estate is probably the most scenic and picturesque place not just in Wicklow, but in Ireland
Thousands of people use the amenity each year
There would be great value to owning the house and its 5,000 acres
It is an incredible site
I do not know if the Minister of State has been there
It is very accessible
As Deputy Burton has said, the current owner has made it accessible
We do not want it to become inaccessible
The land belongs to the people of the country and they should not be denied
If it is sold it could become inaccessible meaning that people could not use it
I am sure that will be fought very hard
We are asking that the State should try to buy it in order to make it accessible for the people of Ireland
It has huge potential to be part of the Wicklow Mountains National Park and be an asset to the people of Ireland
The Minister of State's reply was quite positive
He said the Department could also consider acquiring the property if the price fell within a range
If the price reduced, would the State be interested in buying the house? It would be even better if it was donated to the State
Is the Minister of State saying that if the price reduced dramatically, the State would engage with the owner?
Deputy Burton has robbed all my lines
I would be interested in the Minister of State's view on the sale of Luggala estate
I probably go to Wicklow once a week
The backdrop with that road coming into Luggala estate is probably the most scenic and picturesque place not just in Wicklow, but in Ireland
Thousands of people use the amenity each year
There would be great value to owning the house and its 5,000 acres
It is an incredible site
I do not know if the Minister of State has been there
It is very accessible
As Deputy Burton has said, the current owner has made it accessible
We do not want it to become inaccessible
The land belongs to the people of the country and they should not be denied
If it is sold it could become inaccessible meaning that people could not use it
I am sure that will be fought very hard

As a person who has worked in the field of disability and has always advocated for the rights of people with disabilities, it is imperative that the Bill is debated
I welcome the Bill which, it is to be hoped, finally addresses the ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in Ireland
It is now almost ten years since it was signed but, as of yet, Ireland has failed to ratify the convention
Over 150 countries around the world have ratified the convention since its conception
Many people find the length of time it has taken to comply and ratify a convention that stops discrimination on the basis of ability quite extraordinary
Other countries have ratified the convention without adhering to every single piece of legislation
The very principles of ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities will be a major step forward for the 600,000 people with disabilities in Ireland, who comprise 13% of the population
It will also send a very clear signal that their rights are respected and vindicated
There has been a decade of delay or, more aptly, a lost decade during which persons with disabilities were discriminated against disproportionately in terms of health, poverty, education and employment
Part of the Bill is to be welcomed as it will amend outdated legislation and include people with disabilities who were excluded
The hard of hearing have been excluded from jury duty
We need to introduce a standard in regard to reasonable accommodation
The quota for the employment in the public sector of people with disabilities needs to be extended to Garda civilian staff
More responsibility needs to be given to the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission
I disagree with the introduction of certain sections on Committee Stage, in particular those dealing with the Social Welfare Act and the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act
People with disabilities have been waiting over ten years for this country to ratify the convention
Perhaps there is a fear that the State will be sued because it is breaching the legal requirements involved
I hope ratification of the convention takes place in the next couple of weeks
It is to be hoped that people with disabilities can finally become part of a society which has largely forgotten about and discriminated against them over the past ten years
It is to be hoped that the Bill will finally ensure the ratification of the convention
Will the Taoiseach give a definite date for the review by the Health Products Regulatory Authority, which used to be the medicines board, of the latest policy on medicinal cannabis use in Ireland? Many people inside and outside the House are keen to get clarification on the use of medicinal cannabis
We have put through legislation
Although the Minister is not here, could we get a firm date on the review? I am sure the Taoiseach could provide such a date
The question has been asked but I will respond to the Minister's comments
I have no doubt but that the current American Administration is probably the most pro-Israel administration in the history of the United States
This is a provocative act to try to humiliate the Palestinian people
There is a lethal cocktail that has a maniac called Donald Trump and another psychopathic maniac called Benjamin Netanyahu
What will the Minister do about this and what will he relay to the American ambassador and Israeli ambassador, who should be expelled from this country?
I hope the Minister will relay the concern to the Israeli ambassador
As I stated, that person should have been expelled from this country a long time ago
If Donald Trump tries to move the American Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, it will provoke an intifada in Palestine
The people of Palestine have every right to not only wage resistance against Americans but also against the Israeli occupiers
We will see Donald Trump's trajectory, as he is probably the most pro-Israeli and pro-Zionist President of all time
His action will be met with much resistance not only from the Palestinian people of Jerusalem but from Palestine as a whole
That is not possible
The Israeli ambassador should be expelled from the country

I will get the niceties out of the way because I will probably not be nice to the Taoiseach for the rest of the year, but I wish him and his colleagues a happy new year
When will this country ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities? I have raised this many times with the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Finian McGrath
It is like waiting for Godot at this stage
People with disabilities and other members of the public are awaiting a decision by this Government
The convention has already been ratified by 156 countries and Ireland must ratify it without further delay
A protest will be held outside the Dáil on Thursday at 12 noon by people with disabilities
People are awaiting a decision and they want it now
Is there a specific date?
That is a very poor response
I am very proud that this Bill has been proposed
There has been much commentary and debate in the past six months and previously on the housing crisis the country faces
A perfect storm of a lack of social housing, spiralling rents and Government mismanagement has done untold social damage
The worst insecurity is the knowledge that one could be evicted at the whim of one's landlord
This is a relatively simple Bill
While it does not do everything needed to stem the tide of people becoming homeless, it does contain practical provisions that will stop families ending up in emergency accommodation
It discourages landlords from using the spurious excuse of needing a property for a family member by forcing them to compensate tenants
It will remove the need for a house to be vacant in order to be sold
It gives more rights to tenants in terms of security of tenure
The Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Bill introduced by the Minister and debated extensively in this Chamber did not deal with these issues
The endless calls during that debate for a moratorium on evictions were washed over by arguments about the rights of private property as per the Constitution
I do not blame the Minister personally for the housing crisis but I do blame his party
I also blame the system that his party upholds for the crisis of housing
I am an optimist by nature, but I am pessimistic when I see the same failed policies of previous Governments and Ministers that do nothing to address the fundamental issues of housing need and social justice in Ireland
In any system that gives priority to private property over citizenship, housing and the basic right to shelter will always be secondary
The system needs to be dismantled
I commend the Bill to the House
I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for facilitating me
I will abbreviate my question to the Minister
Has her attention been drawn to the case of a person who was killed in 2011 in a hit-and-run incident? Has her attention been drawn to the family's concerns that if the guilty party had been properly dealt with before the fatal incident, the person would not have been killed? The family alleges there is evidence of failure of inquiry
I met Shane's mother, Lucia, four or five months ago
I spoke to her at length, as the Minister and the Taoiseach have
To say I was shocked about what happened to her son is an understatement
There is a lot of evidence and paperwork to show there was a litany of mistakes and failures by everybody - the police, the Judiciary and the Department of Justice and Equality
Shane would still be here if not for those failures
We cannot bring Shane back
Lucia knows that
There has been a serious miscarriage of justice
Shane would still be alive had it not been for the failures of the people I have mentioned
The family deserve at least an independent inquiry
Everybody's reputation is on the line here
Lucia knows Shane will not come back but the family deserves justice for Shane and a public inquiry
With respect to the Minister, I do not understand
I will be straight with the Minister
The GSOC investigation has been going on for the past five years
What is worst about the case is that this man never went to jail for killing somebody
He was deported
What has happened is absolutely outrageous
Shane deserves a public inquiry
I will put the Minister's reputation on the line
If there is not an inquiry, the Minister should review her position as Minister for Justice and Equality
It adds insult to injury for the family because they cannot get justice
They will get justice
They deserve justice in a court of law
Any investigation so far has been a whitewash
I call on the Minister to say now that there will be a public inquiry into Shane's death
Why has it taken five years?

Shall I take the question? I think we are okay-----
I apologise
I thought we were stuck for time
I ask the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice and Equality her views as to whether there is a legal barrier in view of the lack of any barrier to ratifying the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities
The Minister of State and I had a duel on this issue a few weeks ago
As most people know, over 156 countries have ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities
Why has Ireland not ratified it? The Minister of State said previously that he would try to have it ratified before Christmas
I understand he is now considering the possibility of ratifying it in the third week of January
When will this country ratify the convention? Can the Minister of State say categorically that it will be ratified very early in the new year?
I appreciate that progress is being made
However, the Minister of State cannot say categorically when the convention will be ratified
We could be having the same conversation this time next year
That would be an insult to anybody who has been campaigning on this issue
Will the Minister of State give the people who are listening to us an indication of some sort of timeframe in this regard? Obviously, he cannot give an exact date
Those who have been following this debate for the last eight years are probably getting tired of it
I accept that the Minister of State's bona fides on this issue are genuine, but I emphasise to him that in the interests of giving people confidence in the convention, there is a need to say that Ireland will ratify the convention in January or February
They have failed

They have failed
I support this amendment
Emergency hormonal contraception, or the morning-after pill, as it is more commonly known, is an important addition to the range of available birth control measures in Ireland, from oral contraception to medical and surgical abortion
To further the development of reproductive health care services, it is important that the morning after pill be easily available from local pharmacies without prescription and without charge to GMS patients
Emergency contraception provides relief from worry about an unwanted pregnancy and an opportunity to reassess contraception arrangements as a contraception method may fail
The considering of other options is facilitated by a consultation with a doctor or a nurse, if required, on such occasions
Emergency hormonal contraception is an important part of reproductive health care services and should be available without prescription or charge to GMS patients
I urge Deputies to support the amendment
I ask the Minister for Health the preparations he is making across his Department to ensure rights will be vindicated for the persons with disabilities in the care of the health service and under his area of responsibility in view of the imminence of the Government's commitment to ratifying the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities; and if he will make a statement on the matter
I wish to point something out to the Minister of State
I am sure he is aware of it because he has a good track record on it
Ireland has been pretty poor on equality for people with disabilities
Currently, 156 countries have ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities
Ireland signed it almost nine years ago but never came good on it
Even Ireland's UN representative wrote to the UN in April 2012 promising to ratify the convention
The people listening to this debate want to know when this will come into effect because the Disability Act is flagrantly breached all the time
People with disabilities are being left behind
The convention must be signed and ratified to ensure equality for people with disabilities
That is all well and good but will the Minister of State not put a timeframe on it? This has been dragging on for years
The Government signed the UN convention nine years ago
Why has it not been ratified and put into effect? We must send a strong signal to people with disabilities that this will be done within a matter of months
If this is allowed to go on and on, the convention will never be ratified
Will the Minister of State give a commitment to ratify the convention within six months or even earlier? If he commits to ratifying it within the next three to six months, people will believe that the Government is serious about this issue
Will it be done after the Christmas recess?
I will sign it too

I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time
I welcome everyone in the Gallery today
Usually, this is a quiet and lonely place, but it is great to have the visitors here and it is good to see friends
I thank the other political parties for facilitating this Private Members' Bill
It is being fast-tracked and I commend the other political parties on allowing it to happen
I commend the efforts of a former Member, Luke Flanagan, who put forward a Bill in 2013 dealing with medical cannabis
He is in Brussels at the moment, probably a better place to be
Today I stand here under circumstances of my choosing, but the circumstances of many individuals and families suffering throughout the country are certainly not of their choosing
I will put a question to those in the House and those listening or watching the debate
What would they do if their child, parent, sister, brother or friend was diagnosed with an illness that could be treated with a medicine that was unobtainable? Less than nine months ago, my knowledge of medical cannabis was limited
I had certain vague ideas, perhaps even ignorance, on the subject of medicinal cannabis
My journey so far is part of an ongoing journey of education, seeking out the medical benefits of cannabis in order that I can represent the tens of thousands who need this medicine and who would benefit greatly from improvements in its accessibility
During the past six months I have met and corresponded with some extraordinary people in extraordinary circumstances
Some of the life stories I have heard are truly remarkable
The story of Marie Fleming's battle with multiple sclerosis and her husband Tom helping her to relieve the pain using cannabis is harrowing on the one hand but, on the other, a story of love that shows the medical benefits of using cannabis when other standard medicines have failed
Extraordinary too is the story of Mark Gaynor and his struggle to bring comfort and relief to his five year old son, Ronan, who suffers from a rare childhood cancer
I would like to mention one person in particular who I think the people of this country have taken to their hearts
Vera Twomey's campaign for her daughter, Ava, has been the catalyst that has not only won the hearts and minds of the public, but also forced the Government to review its policy on medical cannabis
Vera's courage and determination has meant that she has spoken up not only for Ava, but also the countless others who find themselves in similar distressing circumstances
We owe Ms Twomey, her family and many others who have come out publicly on this issue an enormous amount of gratitude for having told their personal stories
In the 19th century, a man probably largely forgotten in Irish history, William Brooke O'Shaughnessy, a doctor from Limerick in the early part of that century, popularised medical cannabis
O'Shaughnessy's vision and forward thinking encouraged modern medicine to engage with the healing benefits of cannabis
His legacy lives on in his contribution to the greater good in treating people with medical cannabis
Unfortunately, however, over the past five decades, the cannabis plant has been stigmatised, criminalised and demonised by governments and corporations with their own vested interests
The war on drugs has been a miserable failure, and all over the world governments are now picking up the pieces
The Bill provides that patients can receive a legally protected, secure supply of a quality controlled cannabis-based medicine that is safe and effective
This includes provision for a regulatory authority to issue licences for importation and supply and to ensure products are labelled accurately for contents, including THC and CBD, the two best studied cannabinoids with established medicinal value
The Bill provides for the funding of a research institute to improve knowledge about the use and effects of cannabis-based medicines
It allows for legally protected access to cannabis-based products by patients with a recommendation from a doctor to the effect that they suffer from a condition that responds to cannabis-based medicines
Under the regulations for retail licences, labelled, quality assured cannabis-based medicines would only be available from a pharmacist
Advertising or promoting cannabis-based medicines and sale directly to children would be prohibited
Regarding the benefits of the Bill, its essence is to relieve people's unnecessary suffering from a variety of medical conditions and to promote recovery through improving safe access to an effective medicine
The recent report to the UK all-party parliamentary group for drug policy reform, the Barnes report, outlined evidence for the medicinal use of cannabis-based products in a wide range of medical conditions, such as chronic pain, spasticity, nausea and vomiting, particularly in the context of chemotherapy, cancer, fibromyalgia, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease - the list goes on and on
There is also increasing evidence that when patients use cannabis-based medicines, the use of more toxic alternatives such as opioid painkillers and sedatives is reduced, as are the more severe side effects of and deaths from these drugs
It is genuinely remarkable and an amazing medical advantage that no patient has ever died as a result of using cannabis
There is a tide in the affairs of men,Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune
The fortune here today is not the fortune of war but the fortunes of our suffering constituents, children and adults who have within their grasp a medicine with great promise
Let us now put medicinal cannabis within their reach
I commend the Bill to the House
Make it medicine
Make it happen
It has been a healthy debate and I have taken everybody's view on board
It has been quite an emotional and hard week for me but not as hard as some people's circumstances
I can see people in the Gallery whom I have gotten to know over the past few months and I consider the likes of Ava, Paul, Colette, Mark and a few others whose names I forget to be my friends
It has been a fantastic five or six months, even though I have heard about the hard circumstances of their lives
There has almost been a reawakening of goodness to want to help people
I accept the bona fides of every Member
I disagree with much of what the Minister says but he is genuine on this issue
I disagree with Deputy Harty and I am slightly disappointed by some of his comments
It is his own opinion
I respect him but I am disappointed
Many provisions in the Bill could be amended, including those relating to the research institute and the cannabis authority
That was intentional because I am new to this game
The last thing I want to do is set up another quango
I would not be called Gino Kenny then; I would be called Quango Kenny
It has been a healthy debate
There is no going back, just like Vera Twomey's walk
When she first suggested it to me, I thought, "Oh God, what is she doing?", but it did awaken people and it did awaken the Minister and he acted
It is up to the House now to act for the benefit of many people
It is a healthy day for democracy in Ireland that we can agree on something very valuable to many valuable people
I move: "That the Bill be referred to the Select Committee on Health pursuant to Standing Orders 84A(3)(
It looks as if I am jumping the queue as the Labour Party Deputies are not here
Private health insurance is part of Ireland's two-tier health system
Health insurance is a way for people to jump the public queue for health care, particularly elective surgery and investigations like scopes and scans
This distorts our health service by prioritising health care on the basis of wealth and not medical need
As this means the most needy get more sick as they wait, it causes unnecessary suffering
Those who jump the queue onto consultants' private waiting lists are seen more quickly by those consultants because decisions on who sees consultants are not made on the basis of need
In 2011, the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government that was in office at the time promised to bring an end to the two-tier system by putting everyone on private health insurance
The proposed system of universal private health insurance, or UHI, was not costed by Fine Gael until very late in the day
By 2013, it was a flop
It was prohibitively expensive at approximately €3,000 per person
A system of private health insurance distorts the way patients are seen
It sucks out money in profits, advertising, corporate salaries, bonuses and transaction costs
The billing, accountancy and legal costs associated with private health insurance are above and beyond those encountered in the public system, where the bill is one's tax bill
UHI collapsed, not surprisingly, and Fine Gael still has nothing to put in its place
Instead, we have the ongoing sticking plaster of a wasteful and inefficient supplementary private health insurance system that is propped up by tax breaks
The National Treatment Purchase Fund is continuing to sell patients on public waiting lists to private hospitals, often to be seen by consultants who have their own public waiting lists
Private health insurance should be replaced by a system of universal health care as advocated by the Anti-Austerity Alliance-People Before Profit
If this does not happen, the current wasteful and unwieldy market system will continue to need constant attention and intervention by the State to prevent the overcharging of sicker and more elderly patients as part of the system of risk equalisation, which involves redistributing payments between different private health insurers
This system of health insurance, tax rebates, stamp duty and credits unnecessarily complicates the health service
It also duplicates the functions of the taxation and funding systems of the Departments of Finance and Health
In 2016, private health insurance covers 46% of the population
This represents a reduction from 51% in 2008
Many of these policies offer very limited cover, usually for hospital overnight stays and accident and emergency charges
The decrease in the number of people paying for health insurance is largely due to reduced incomes as a result of austerity and the mass emigration of our youth
It is estimated that the large private bureaucracies of the private health insurance companies and the Health Insurance Authority handle €2
45 billion a year
That money would be better and more efficiently spent as part of the public health system
The community rating system that this Bill is designed to regulate through risk equalisation payments has been described as being designed to promote "intergenerational solidarity" regardless of "age, gender or health status"
Anti-Austerity Alliance-People Before Profit strongly recommends this social solidarity, but equally strongly it points to the waste associated with private health insurance and the distorting effects it has on our health system
The use of progressive taxation to increase the tax rates paid by the richest individuals and corporations would fund equal access and improve health by reducing inequality
The sooner private health insurance is replaced by a national health service, the sooner all of this wasteful, complex, time-consuming and ultimately unnecessary regulation will come to an end
The two-tier health system is bad for everybody's health
I thank the Minister of State for taking the question
The Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, recently met the parents of Ava Barry and called for a review of cannabis-based medicines
Sativex is a cannabis-based product which was approved in 2014 but is still not available to multiple sclerosis sufferers
I understand the Minister's hands are tied, up to a point, by the existing law
The Cannabis for Medicinal Use Regulation Bill 2016 will deal with the long-term effects of the grey area of cannabis-based products
In the short term, I will try to untie the Minister's hands by asking him to facilitate compassionate access under the exempt medicinal products statutory instruments and any other means at his disposal, particularly in the cases of Ava Barry and Ronan Gaynor
Ava is a beautiful six year old child who has Dravet syndrome, which involves intractable epilepsy, often with dozens of seizures a day
The condition is known to respond well to cannabis-based products
Ronan Gaynor is a four year old boy with a very rare form of brain tumour called diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma
It is a very rare and aggressive form of childhood cancer, involving severe pain and distress
It responds to cannabis-based products
If a recognised doctor writes to the Minister on behalf of Ava and Ronan to apply for permission to prescribe cannabis-based medicines, will the Minister consider the doctor's application and ensure these children gain access to the cannabis-based medicines which they medically need? I note the report by Professor Michael Barnes
It was the unanimous view that medical cannabis has huge medical benefits for a range of illnesses
We need to step into the 21st century in this country
Children like Ava and Ronan are at an extremely difficult point in their short lives, as are their parents
These products can help
The research and data are available and we need to import these products under the guidance of a doctor to help these children
I plead with the Minister of State because I am the voice of those children and their parents in the House today
Will he help these children?
I understand that next week a doctor will visit Ronan in Galway and Ava in west Cork and will correspond with the Minister early next week recommending cannabis-based products for them
These children cannot wait and they need these products as soon as possible
Hopefully, the Minister will see common sense and that these children need these products as soon as possible
Under licence, the doctor will prescribe that medication to them with the guidance of their parents and, hopefully, it will have medical benefits for them
I welcome the Minister of State's reply
He is saying it is ultimately up to the Minister to grant the licence for these children
That application will happen over the next week and, hopefully, the Minister will look favourably on it
I thank the Minister of State for taking the question

I understand that next week a doctor will visit Ronan in Galway and Ava in west Cork and will correspond with the Minister early next week recommending cannabis-based products for them
These children cannot wait and they need these products as soon as possible
Hopefully, the Minister will see common sense and that these children need these products as soon as possible
Under licence, the doctor will prescribe that medication to them with the guidance of their parents and, hopefully, it will have medical benefits for them
I welcome the Minister of State's reply
He is saying it is ultimately up to the Minister to grant the licence for these children
That application will happen over the next week and, hopefully, the Minister will look favourably on it
A Cheann Comhairle, may I speak?
Can I state my disappointment that-----
-----Deputies have blocked the taking of this Bill
I want to put that on the record
I want to put on record that certain Deputies, of which there were only a few,-----
I am not
I am sharing time with Deputy Bríd Smith
Although I recognise the €5 increase in social welfare payments as a step in the right direction, I do not think any attempt was made in the budget to unwind some of the harsh effects of recent budgets
Some sectors of society have been failed in the social welfare system and not been protected, as they should have been
The examples I will give of the people who are discriminated against the most are of those who did not cause the crisis or benefit from the so-called boom, yet they are the ones who felt the harsh brunt of austerity and are living in poverty
I will list some figures and discuss in further detail the two groups which have been discriminated against the most
They are young people and one-parent families
In 2009 jobseeker's allowance was €204
In 2017 it will be €193 for those aged over 26 years, €102
70 for those aged between 18 and 24 and €147
80 for those aged between 25 and 26
The minimum loss for a jobseeker is €11, but for those under the age of 25 years, the loss of income is significant
If someone is aged 25 years, the loss is €56
50, but if they are under 24, it is €101
This mirrors the discrimination for newly qualified teachers or nurses in terms of pay equality
What we are saying is if that someone finds himself or herself unemployed, he or she will be discriminated against in rates of social welfare payments payable and that if he or she starts a job in the public sector, he or she will face pay inequality
Unfortunately, the country does not just discriminate only against young people
Lone parents and their children have shamefully been let down by the Government
We cannot tackle the level of child poverty if we do not address the cuts inflicted on one-parent families
The rates of child poverty among children living in households headed by one parent are a national disgrace and it is important to look at them
The rate of consistent poverty among children in Ireland is 11
When we look at this headline rate in detail, we see that the poverty rate among children headed by a lone parent is 22
1%, while in a two-parent household with fewer than four children, it is 7
If we are to make any attempt to tackle the level of child poverty, we must address the poverty traps and barriers faced by lone parents, but nothing was done in the budget
When we look at the cuts inflicted on lone parents, it is clear that no other sector of society was hit as hard
Much has been said about equality proofing, but it was always known that the level of poverty among lone parent families was significantly higher than in the rest of society
What the previous Government, of which the Minister was a member, did and the Government continues to do is politically proof rather than equality proof budgets
By this, I mean that it decides what it can cut that may not prove damaging politically to it
Lone parents were an easy target because the Government could falsely stereotype and stigmatise them under the guise of labour activation measures
There was no discussion of the fact that at the time 60% of lone parents in receipt of the one-parent family payment were in receipt of a reduced payment as they were in part-time employment or participating in a community employment scheme
There was also no discussion of the barriers, particularly when it came to child care and other supports needed, faced by them
The Government portrayed them as a group that needed to be activated
In looking at what has happened to lone parents it is important to list the cuts made
In 2009 the one-parent family payment was €204
In 2017 it will be €193
The qualifying age of children was reduced from 18 years to seven
In 2009 the child benefit payment for one child was €166
In 2017 it will be €140
The back to school allowance payable for a child in primary school was cut from €200 to €100, while the allowance payable for a child in secondary school was cut from €305 to €200
These are just the headline figures
The worst measure inflicted on lone parents involved the changes made to payments and entitlements
Contrary to the mantra that lone parents needed to be activated, it was those already working who suffered a financial loss
The Minister's claim that 3,000 lone parents are better off because of the changes is false and misleading
If any lone parent was to increase his or her working hours, of course, his or her income would go up, but what the Minister has failed to address is the fact that if he or she had increased his or her working hours prior to July 2015, the financial gain would have been bigger
The Minister also fails to acknowledge the thousands who had a huge reduction in income, and that those already working 19 hours on FIS suffered a loss despite the increase in this budget of the income disregard to €110
This is €37
50 below what it was prior to the cuts
It is important to note that the €147
50 it was prior to the cuts had been the same rate since 1997 when it was introduced
There was never a gravy train for lone parents but a series of failed policies and rather than address them the previous Government, of which the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, was a member, cut them further and brought in policy changes restricting their access to third level education and giving a financial loss to working parents
I see nothing in this budget that restores any loss to these parents
Prior to the budget the Minister was made aware of problems with maintenance payments
The transition from the one-parent family payment to jobseeker's transition payment did not take into consideration the "liable relative" legislation
The Department wrote out to thousands of liable relatives to tell them that they had no further obligation to the Department to pay
Despite this having been brought to the Minister's attention through a petition from lone parents, he has not dealt with it
Indeed, his response was insensitive to any woman who escaped domestic violence, saying they must prove their abuse
Local Intreo offices are informing parents if they do not seek maintenance their payment will be cut
It has also been brought to the Minister's attention that deducting 100% of maintenance payments from rent allowance was causing great difficulties for many parents, especially for those where the maintenance is not being paid, or not paid on time from ex-partners
The Minister, like previous Ministers for Social Protection, went for headline changes
If he was really interested in tackling inequality for our youth or child poverty among lone-parent families, he would have listened to the groups who had been pleading with him to make genuine changes
He will lock out the teachers on Monday
Will the Taoiseach indicate if there are any proposals for bringing forward legislation around dignity in dying? The Dying with Dignity Bill 2015 was sponsored by Government Member, Deputy John Halligan
Is there a proposal to bring the legislation forward?
I am slightly confused
Am I asking the question?
Am I asking that question now?
Will I ask the question?
I think the Minister has already answered most of my question
I will cut to the chase
The Egyptian authorities are playing mind games
They have gotten into the heads of the Minister, the Taoiseach and, most importantly, Ibrahim
An e-mail from his sister outlining his well-being is quite shocking
He is depressed, which of course he would be
He has refused any visits from embassy staff
What is going on is terrible and the Egyptian authorities are dragging the case out for their own purposes
I want to mention two names to the Minister and I hope he can comment on them
One name is Peter Greste
He is an Australian citizen who was released under the decree of law 140
The other is a man called Mohamed Soltan, an American citizen, who was also released under the decree of law 140
Why has Ibrahim not been released? That is my simple question
I ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade his views on the reports of state-sanctioned death squads and vigilantism in the Philippines under President Duterte; the assistance being offered to a person - details supplied, which I will name now in a second - and his or her family in an appeal in the Philippines against a 12-year prison sentence for a trivial offence; and if he will make a statement on the matter
I will have to
I appreciate that things have been done in the background
O'Cochlain was found in 2013 with a tiny amount of cannabis and he is stating that it was put on him for reasons of bribery
The worrying thing is that this Philippino president sounds like a maniac
The stats are quite incredible
Since 1 July, 3,600 people have been killed in the Philippines
There are extra-judicial killings, death squads and incitements to kill from the president in raging a drugs war
Amongst all this, Mr
O'Cochlain is in fear of his life
I believe he is living under pretty horrible circumstances
He has been there for the last three years
Terribly, three of his relatives have died in those three years
He has not been able to come back to Ireland
I am hoping that the Minister and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade can do everything in their power to get this man's passport back
I am slightly confused

Am I asking that question now?

I welcome everyone in the Gallery
I observe the absolutely disgraceful non-attendance of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil
There are literally six people from the two parties, which is an absolute disgrace
No wonder people do not have confidence in the Chamber
Ireland has come a long way since 1983
That journey of 33 years has led to a sea change in the fight for women's right to choose
There has also been the arduous journey which tens of thousands of women have taken from this State to access abortion services
This journey is one of the hardest journeys any woman can make in having to deal with a crisis pregnancy, sometimes alone, sometimes with their partners, families and friends
This journey will continue as long as we hide from the reality that 3,450 women and girls travel to Britain each year to have an abortion
The financial hardship this imposes makes an extremely difficult situation even more difficult for women who have to travel to Britain to end their pregnancy
Many people like myself, and I am sure countless others in the country, have been on another journey, in getting to the position that ultimately it is a woman's right to choose
Today's generation of young women will not tolerate the Government's inaction and complete ambiguity on repealing the eighth amendment
Last year's marriage equality referendum showed this is not the Ireland of 1983 but the Ireland of 2016
The Catholic Church's moral grip on all of our lives should be a thing of the past and not a thing of the future
It is not a case of if but when there is a referendum
It will not be because of a citizens' assembly or the ineptitude of the Government, but the people demanding one
A sorry shame litters our history with regard to women's rights
There are women behind the anonymous letters in the X case, the Y case and the C case who went through absolute torture
The journey has never ended and it will not end
Give women the right to choose
Give the citizens of the country the right to a referendum
That is ridiculous
Is the allegation withdrawn?
I will be brief
I hope the Minister of State will be able to answer my questions about the assessment of needs for children with disabilities in the Dublin Mid-West constituency
This is a crisis of our time, in some ways
The position in my locality is mirrored across the State, where there are huge waiting times for children to be assessed
Given that early intervention is of key importance, why are children having to wait so long?
I think we have a problem because waiting times are so long that they contravene the Disability Act 2005
Essentially, this means children are waiting for services for more than six months
The State is breaking its own law
This has serious implications for the State and for the children who are not being seen
There is a possibility that families will bring the State to court because their children are not being seen on time
The statistics are quite incredible
Many children have been waiting for these services for up to 18 months
Approximately 2,000 children under the age of five are waiting for occupational therapy services
Some 20,000 children are waiting to see speech and language therapists
According to Inclusion Ireland, the speech and language services one receives are greatly influenced by where one lives
There are 162 children for every therapist in Ireland at the moment
It is recommended that there should be a therapist for every 30 to 65 children
Major questions arise when children and their families get assessments of need, but the bigger question is the waiting time for occupational therapy services, physiotherapy and speech and language therapy
In this day and age, nobody should be waiting more than six months, but that is happening in Dublin Mid-West and across the country
There are huge waiting times of over 18 months in Cork, for example
It is not acceptable, especially in a year when we are marking the 100th anniversary of 1916
The Proclamation refers to "cherishing all the children of the nation", but at this moment in time the State is not cherishing its children
It is actually failing them
That has serious and profound consequences for families and for the State
I have to say it is a shame that this country cannot provide crucial early intervention services to children in their time of need

People Before Profit welcomes the opportunity to discuss supports for people with dementia in the community and to draw attention to the urgent need for resources for them
I have first-hand experience in this area as I worked in a hospital ward specifically for patients with dementia and Alzheimer's disease
The education and life experience I received there will always shape who I am
The cruelty of dementia is only mirrored by the sheer compassion and love for our loved ones in their final years
Lives that were so fruitful and full of happiness have been taken away by this cruel disease
However, it beggars belief that Fianna Fáil has tabled this motion this week, after a budget that had, as one newspaper put it, "Fianna Fáil written all over it"
Surely the time for Fianna Fáil to show its support for older people in general and people with dementia in particular was last week
Dementia is a condition which requires greater recognition and support, as its incidence is increasing with the increasing age of our population
It is good that more people are living to an older age, but with increasing age comes a need to plan better health and social care services
A study published this year by UCD researchers, the Alzheimer Society of Ireland and others, entitled "I'd Prefer to Stay at Home, But I Don't Have a Choice", reported that:The present social care approach has not been resourced adequately to meet the actual needs of older people
The HSE are spending less now on home support services than they did in 2008, despite the increase in the numbers of people aged 85 and over and those living with complex conditions such as dementia
Older people cannot access safe, compassionate, individualised and quality care when they need it
Home help and home care services were top of the list on budget day for support groups such as Age Action Ireland and the Alzheimer Society of Ireland
The records of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael Governments are equally appalling on this issue
During the years of austerity cuts to services to pay off bankers' gambling debts, Fianna Fáil attacked home help hours by reducing them from 12
63 million hours in 2008 to 11 million hours in 2011
Fine Gael and the Labour Party continued the austerity cuts and slashed home help hours to 9
74 million in 2013
In 2016, the number receiving all home care, that is, both home help hours and home care packages, has still not recovered to the 2008 level, despite the fact that the number of people aged over 65 years and over 85 years has continued to rise
In 2016, only 63,000 people were receiving home care compared with 64,000 in 2008
Meanwhile the population aged over 65 years has increased by 30%, from 481,00 in 2008 to 624,000 in 2016
As Age Action stated in its budget submission:Between 2008 and 2012, the number of people receiving home care services (home help and home care packages) fell by nearly 30 per cent (17,138 people)
There has been a nearly 30 per cent increase in the population aged 65 and over between 2008 and 2016
The evidence clearly points to the needs of many older people going unmet
The increasing use of for-profit agencies has meant worse conditions for staff and a system of speeded up care which allocates insufficient time for even personal care
It leaves much domestic care undone and dependent on relatives and friends who are often elderly and in poor health themselves
Clearly, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael stand condemned for targeting the older population with cuts in services and welfare to bail out the rich bankers and developers, who play the tune to which they dance
AAA-PBP would be happy to support a motion proposing to increase the funding of home care, hire more social workers and social care workers, provide home care on a demand-led and needs basis in every area, increase the pension without delay, abolish prescription charges, water charges and property tax, improve the household benefits package or any of a host of other measures that would improve the lives of older people and people with dementia
This motion makes no such practical proposals and hides and denies the responsibility of previous Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael Governments, as well as the current Fianna Fáil-Fine Gael coalition
This failure and denial of responsibility by those parties should also be noted
The Deputy should withdraw that remark
I wish to share time with Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett
As with all budgets, the devil is in the detail and this budget is no different
Since 2008, the social damage done by successive budgets has been incalculable
For the average person listening today, the budget will not change their economic situation one iota
The housing crisis, which is the crisis of our time, still rages without abate
At this very moment, there are over 1,500 families in emergency accommodation
This situation is not only completely unacceptable, but the measures in this budget do not go anywhere near challenging the fundamental issue of why so many families find themselves in this position
The announcement by the Minister of €105 million for the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme only copper-fastens the desocialisation of social housing
This will only compound the already long waiting times for people to be housed by the local authority
Essentially, what the Minister announced on Tuesday is a boon to landlordism and the construction industry
It is misleading to state that 21,000 applicants for social housing will have their housing needs met
I say this as a person who has been a council tenant, as my family have been
What is wrong with local authorities building houses? I utterly reject and find it offensive that, somehow, local authority housing and the people who seek to be housed by the local authority equate to social problems
Let me be crystal clear
HAP and RAS are not social housing; they are the privatisation of social housing by proxy
Like many in this House, I have received numerous e-mails, phone calls and correspondence in regard to home care hours
As a former home care worker myself, I know the impact home care hours can have
Some 950 home care packages simply are not enough
The health system is playing catch-up due to the lack of home care hours
Some 8% of the population aged over 65 are in receipt of some form of home care services, and the average is five hours per week, based on need and availability of resources
In 2008, 12
63 million hours were delivered to 55,000 clients whereas, in 2015, seven years later, that figure was down by 2 million
Since 2010, there has been a 17% increase in the number of those aged 65 and over, so there has been no attempt to keep pace with the demand for home care hours and packages
We can clearly see there is a gaping hole in home help hours and packages that still has not been addressed
Although the 650 home care packages are welcome, this does not go far enough, by any stretch of the imagination
There was a lot of talk in this Chamber about mental health and how the Government would address funding to mental health services
Historically, the mental health budget is 50% less than the average in Britain
In this budget, I cannot see a firm commitment to implementing A Vision for Change in regard to mental health services
Much has been made of the €5 being given to social welfare recipients, including pensioners
The ongoing age discrimination against those under 26 sends out the message that this is no country for young people
Youth unemployment stands at 16%, more than double the figure in 2007
Let us make it relative to other pay increases, namely, the pay rises of €5,000 for Deputies in this House
I want to put on record that Deputies are not worth the rise; they get enough as it is and they are very well paid
Ordinary working people who have been crucified over recent years in taxes, including stealth taxes, do not get anything like the pay rises awarded to Deputies
What makes Deputies so special? Deputies seem to think they are God's gift to pay rises
Overall, this is the crumbs from the master's table
The vested interests, the very wealthy and the corporations have not been challenged yet again
Until the Government challenges the real reasons for wealth inequality and the nature of our economic and political establishment, we will continue to firefight the scandals of the housing crisis and the two-tier health system
Does the Minister for Social Protection stand over his assertion that the one-parent family payment was not cut by the previous Government, and will he make a statement on the matter?
The plan is probably the most ill-thought-out and ill-funded policy of the past four or five years
There are more anomalies and holes in it than any other social welfare policy of the past five years
It has compounded poverty among lone parents
While the Minister is right that it has not touched the core value of the one-parent family payment, it has touched the income of a parent going out to work
Will the Minister comment on it? The income of a parent in receipt of the one-parent family payment has been dramatically cut
I will give the Minister the details after he has responded to me
I will list the main points in terms of income
The qualifying age was cut to seven years and income disregard was cut from €147 to €90, which meant a loss of €28
80 per week for working parents
According to the most significant stat, if a lone parent worked 20 hours for the minimum wage in 2015 and got FIS, he or she would have been down 17% compared with what he or she would have been getting in 2011
If a lone parent worked 28 hours, he or she would have been down 14%
If a lone parent worked 35 hours, he or she would have been down 11%
This is discriminatory
This is what puts lone parents back in the poverty trap
The Government is discriminating against people who want to go out and work
This is a political attack on lone parents by Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the troika
These are facts
No, these are facts
I will listen
I am listening
Where is the child care?
The Minister is an ideologue
I have an ideology
I have a great ideology

The crisis in the mental health system appears to be the perennial problem that simply will not go away
It appears to be the sick man of the health service that does not seem to get better
One of the best demonstrations I attended recently was the protest outside this building last spring
The protest, which was organised by the Union of Students in Ireland and Mental Health Reform, highlighted the detrimental cuts to the mental health service and what impact it was having on citizens
At the protests, I listened to a profound speech about a contributor's own daily struggle with mental health and the problems of accessing mental health services when that person needed them most
At the same time, there were stories of hope and human spirit and of fighting against adversity in times of desperation
Mental health difficulties affect more than half a million people in Ireland
Ireland has the highest suicide rate in Europe among teenage girls and the second highest rate among boys
When people do gain access to mental health services, the lack of funding for psychological and social therapies has led to an over-reliance on the use of medication
The use of medication and coercion in mental health should be minimised due to the potential adverse effects of excessive use
Urgent situations that require a 24-7 urgent response require both a 24-7 community mental health team on call and access to an appropriate emergency department to ensure physical and mental care are assessed in a mental health emergency as they would be in any other health emergency
A Vision for Change, Ireland's national mental health policy, was introduced in 2006 to detail the number of staff required to provide basic mental health services
When taking into account the increase in population, the required number of full-time posts to implement fully the A Vision for Change policy is now 12,240
However, staffing in mental health services has been cut by 10% during the years of austerity and as of April 2016, only 9,533 mental health whole-time equivalents were employed, which is a gap of 2,687 in the number of staff required
This means that for adult services, staff levels are barely over three quarters of what is recommended by the Department of Health but for children, the position is even worse with only half the staff numbers required in place
The Department of Health's own estimate of the cost of filling the staffing gap is €177 million per annum
Ireland only spends 5% of its health budget on mental health services and it would require more than €800 million to bridge that gap
People Before Profit welcomes this motion tabled by Sinn Féin
I also welcome what has been a good debate
As a budget will be announced next week, now is the time to right the wrongs of historical underfunding of the mental health service and give citizens a chance to get well again
When carrying out research for this debate, I looked at a PDF copy of A Vision for Change and I wish to read out what I came across on the very first page, because they are the most profound words
It will take 20 seconds
It states:The Greek name for a butterfly is
Can I just finish? It literally is 20 seconds
I received a telephone call last Saturday from a gentleman in Cork in regard to his wife who suffers from lupus and has been in chronic pain for the past 20 years
The man's wife has been told by her neurologist that if she could access Sativex, which is an oral spray used typically by people who suffer from multiple sclerosis, it could help her condition
I understand that in July 2014 the use of Sativex was licensed in Ireland but that agreement on price has yet to be reached between the HSE and the manufacturers
There are many people who could benefit from treatment with this drug
When will a price on Sativex be agreed between the HSE and the manufacturer so this drug is accessible to people, particularly the wife of the man who contacted me and people suffering from multiple sclerosis?
I understand that the cost of making the drug available is estimated to be €4,000 to €5,000 per patient per annum
Is the Minister of State saying that the manufacturer is out-pricing the HSE or that the HSE does not believe it is getting value for money?

I understand that in July 2014 the use of Sativex was licensed in Ireland but that agreement on price has yet to be reached between the HSE and the manufacturers
There are many people who could benefit from treatment with this drug
When will a price on Sativex be agreed between the HSE and the manufacturer so this drug is accessible to people, particularly the wife of the man who contacted me and people suffering from multiple sclerosis?
I understand that the cost of making the drug available is estimated to be €4,000 to €5,000 per patient per annum
Is the Minister of State saying that the manufacturer is out-pricing the HSE or that the HSE does not believe it is getting value for money?
I will probably take less than one third of the time available
I welcome the Bill as an attempt to improve road safety and reduce the toll of death and disability as a result of road traffic accidents involving motorists, pedestrians and cyclists
The moves to introduce lower speed limits and recognise driver disqualifications in other jurisdictions are welcome
However, I question the soundness of measures that would criminalise people who are not impaired for the purpose of driving and may have taken drugs more than 24 years before being tested as well as people who have taken a drug for medical reasons
There is compelling evidence that cannabis use impairs cognitive function and driving skills and increases crash risk
However, while the relationship between being over the legal limit and impaired is straightforward in the case of alcohol, it is not straightforward with regard to other drugs, particularly cannabis
Tetrahydrocannabinol, THC, is one of the active ingredients in cannabis for which the Bill sets out legal limits for blood tests
The product can be detected in the blood of an individual for hours or days following cannabis use, depending on the frequency of use and other factors
For instance, long-term cannabis users have plasma THC concentrations ranging from 1 microgram per litre to 11 micrograms per litre
This means regular consumers of cannabis for medicinal use who test over the 1 milligram limit for THC may not necessarily be impaired or incapable of controlling their vehicle at the time of testing
The introduction of a medical exemption certificate for cannabis based products for medicinal use is welcome
This is safeguarded from a road safety point of view by the clarification that such a certificate is considered null and void if the holder is thought to be under the influence of drugs to such an extent that he or she is incapable of controlling the vehicle
However, the Bill does not provide any detail on how such impairment would be determined
This matter needs to be further elaborated
In addition, the Bill specifies only cannabis based products that are prescription drugs, which would criminalise those who use cannabis based products for medicinal use that have been recommended by a doctor but are not consumed in a prescription drug formulation, for example, herbal cannabis products
During the pre-legislative scrutiny process, stakeholders queried whether roadside drug testing could potentially be used to prosecute drivers who have illicit drugs in their bodies but who are not impaired
The joint committee questioned whether this was appropriate in the context of a road traffic Bill aimed at improving road safety
The Department noted that the proposed legal limits proposed had been considered in the context of other jurisdictions and the levels provided for were chosen on the basis that they are indicative of recent use
It is, therefore, of concern that the Bill legislates for setting up Garda checkpoints where routine drug testing could criminalise many people who are not impaired and do not pose any danger to road safety
To address these issues, I propose that the Bill be amended to bring it into line with legislation adopted by several EU member states which have implemented a two tier system
This model involves a combination of an impairment based law and legal limit approaches under which drivers who are found to be above the legal limit but not to be impaired are penalised, if at all, by a small fine, while drivers who are impaired by any substance are penalised severely, including by means of a driving ban
Where a person is not over the legal limit or impaired, the results of drug testing under the Bill should not be used to prosecute him or her under any other Act
There is already too great a focus on criminalisation and insufficient focus on health and safety issues
I welcome the elements of the Bill which focus on health and safety and are likely to reduce the levels of death and injury on the roads
However, those elements which increase criminalisation will serve only to distract from the benefits of the legislation
They are threat to civil liberties which will undermine the safety aspects of the Bill and should be removed by amendments on Committee Stage
The motion proposed by Fianna Fáil on the Government's responsibility for high drug costs and pharmacy fees is inadequate and dripping with hypocrisy
Since the late 1980s, successive Fianna Fáil Governments have devastated the health service, cutting bed numbers from more than 18,000 to just over 10,000
Our bed numbers per head of population are now 2
8 per 1,000 compared to an EU average of 4
8 beds per 1,000 population
The majority of these cuts were introduced by Fianna Fáil-led Governments
Equally, staffing levels and the incomes of health services workers were slashed by the most recent Fianna Fáil-led Government
The notion that Fianna Fáil could, in all conscience, criticise anybody for his or her record in the Department of Health is laughable but this is particularly true in respect of drug costs
Between 2002 and 2008 when Fianna Fáil was in power and Deputy Micheál Martin was Minister for Health, drug costs and pharmacy fees in particular and other income earned by pharmacies doubled from €800 million to €1
6 billion
There is no doubt drug costs need to come down
The spend on them in Ireland is more than double that of Denmark while Ireland spends 77% more  To address urgently the problems of access to drugs and the high cost of drugs, we call on the Government to desist from removing drugs from being covered by the General Medical Services, GMS, scheme, abolish prescription charges, set up a national pharmacy co-operative that can offer drugs at prices equivalent to other EU member states such as Denmark and reverse the cuts to both the earnings of health care workers and staffing levels
In light of Ireland's commitment at the UN General Assembly in 2012 to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, when will the necessary legislation be introduced? Given the convention has been already ratified by 156 countries, it is time we ratified it
I will probably need a quarter of the time available to me
As the saying goes, less is more
I welcome this Private Members’ motion on the domiciliary care allowance and easier access to a medical card not based on financial circumstances, but on medical need
The hardship of an acute medical prognosis, which is then questioned and audited by unnecessary bureaucracy, leads to undue hardship
I welcome the Government’s commitment to extend entitlement to a medical card to all children in receipt of the domiciliary care allowance in this year’s budget
I hope the day will arrive when all health care, regardless of income, is universal
Perhaps one day medical cards will be a thing of the past
Public health and access to public health services should be based not on an audit of one’s income, but on one’s health requirements
When one’s child or family member is very sick, one would do anything to make the pain go away
The added stress of having to justify and jump through legal hoops and bureaucracy to get something to which one’s child is entitled does not have a place in a society that calls itself “civil”
Begging and entitlement has no place in the health care system
Compassion and discretion do not have a price tag
I am glad to have an opportunity to raise this important issue
Over the weekend, people will have read astonishing revelations concerning executives in the St
John of God organisation who were paid €1
64 million
Some of the individuals in question received €50,000, while others received €250,000
I worked for St
John of God services for two and a half years, during which I met the best, most dedicated and fantastic people I have every worked with
I also met many fantastic family members of service users and the experience put me in good stead
There is something rotten about these revelations
The chief executive of St
John of God services is paid €182,000 per annum or six times more than the average worker in the organisation
When one delves into the issue, one is shocked by what one discovers
John of God services, which received €130 million last year, signed a service level agreement which states that the organisation must not pay or subsidise salaries or expenses which exceed those normally paid within the public sector
There is something rotten when the chief executive of a voluntary body such as St
John of God services is paid such an extraordinary amount of money when the service level agreement stipulates that no member of staff in the organisation should be paid more than €110,000 per annum
Why is taxpayers' money being allocated to St
John of God services when its executives are being paid such extraordinary amounts? Taxpayers subsidise the health service and the voluntary bodies working in the sector
What does the Government propose to do about this issue? Action must be taken because the problem is not confined to St
John of God services
The same issue arose regarding the Central Remedial Clinic and Rehab in recent years
Having worked in the service, I believe many people will be enraged by recent developments, especially given recent cutbacks in St
John of God services, for example, the closure of St
Raphael's unit in Celbridge
It is outrageous that this has been allowed to happen
I hope the Minister of State will respond
I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive reply
This issue raises a question which is depressing in some ways
From where did St
John of God get the sum of €1
64 million to pay 14 of its senior managers? If it was not provided by the Health Service Executive, it must have been raised by service users' families, as occurs in many voluntary services, through sponsored walks, organised cake sales and so forth
It is very difficult to raise funds these days, yet family members have provided funding to pay a salary of €180,000
The chief executive and other executives who were paid bonuses should resign
I will be careful in my use of language but these people have no shame
No one can justify paying such high salaries, particularly in an organisation such as St
John of God
As I stated, I worked in St
John of God services for many years and it is a great organisation with an amazing staff who provide a fantastic service
The revelations we have heard are unbelievable
I hope the loophole that allowed these payments to be made will be closed
The bigger issue, however, is that the payment of salaries of €90,000, €100,000 or €110,000 to executives in voluntary organisations does not sit well with people
No one is worth such a salary
Ordinary workers in hospitals and other parts of the health service work hard in difficult jobs for a fraction of the pay awarded to managers
There is something very wrong in this industry and I hope it can be addressed in the coming period

I congratulate the Leas-Cheann Comhairle on his election
I will start and finish this contribution with quotes
The first is from an Irish priest and I will conclude with a quote from a Brazilian priest
The first is a person who has challenged social injustice in Ireland, Fr
Peter McVerry
He said:In a community that loves one another, there should be no-one poor, unless all are poor; there should be no-one homeless, no-one lonely, no-one sick or alone without visitors, no-one in prison who has been abandoned and written off, there should be no-one rejected or marginalised
That says everything about Fr
Peter McVerry and what he stands for
I congratulate the Social Democrats on the motion which is apt and topical given what is going on in these services
I spoke earlier about charity in Ireland
I worked for St
John of Gods for a number of years and it is a great organisation
However, the revelation that 14 executives took €1
6 million is sickening
As Deputy Adams said, the average worker in St
John of Gods will earn €25,000 to €35,000
The chief executive is earning six times that amount
The worst part is that the €1
6 million, which was in some ways taxpayers' money, was siphoned off from fund-raisers, for example, the families of service users
People were enriching themselves through voluntary bodies
The charity sector comprises organisations that do vital work in the community and play a role in trying to address inequalities and social injustice, but that is not up to charities
It should be for the State to provide proper funding and services, especially public services
This is almost privatisation by stealth and the corporatisation of charity
The corporate mentality of charities is incredible
Some do very good work, but certain people in the charity business are making a great deal of money for themselves
Sometimes, the poverty industry pays well
I will conclude with a famous quote from a Brazilian priest, Dom Hélder Câmara, that says everything about what charity is really all about and the myths surrounding it
He was a great advocate of social justice, particularly in Brazil
He stated:When I give food to the poor, they call me a saint
When I ask why the poor have no food, they call me a communist
I do not know if the Taoiseach has seen the new report today from Social Justice Ireland
I will outline its main points
If the House is going to deal with it, it is very important
According to Social Justice Ireland the recession has pushed 100,000 more people into poverty, 750,000 people live below the poverty line in the Republic and one in five children live in households with incomes below the poverty line
Obviously the recession is having a huge impact in this country
It is incredible that since 2008, 300 individuals in the State have grown their wealth by €89 billion
On the one hand, we have 300 individuals who since 2008 have grown their wealth by €89 billion while on the other we have 750,000 people in this State living below the poverty line
It is in legislation
That has happened over eight years, when Fianna Fáil was in government and Fine Gael was in government-----
It is proposed legislation
We have to address this issue because this is a social cancer
First, it is to address poverty in this country, but also to address the fact that 300 individuals have acquired €89 billion since 2008
That is absolutely criminal
The Government has to address that
Citizens in this country are suffering because of it
They are not the collateral damage of austerity
This is the human face of austerity and the Government's ideology
Can the Taoiseach address this?
I apologise for the mix-up earlier
The lasagne in the canteen put me off
Positive
The food is very good
I have a few issues with this Energy Bill
First, regarding the duration of membership of the board of the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, it must be kept in mind that the mission of the authority is to play a leading role in transforming Ireland into a society based on sustainable energy
Given this, I would have hoped the board would comprise a mix of people from different backgrounds, including communities and environmentalists involved in the sustainable energy sector
In fact, the Minister will find it is made up overwhelmingly of people with a background in government, consultancy and law firms and especially from the world of business, including, for example, consultancy firms working for gas and oil exploration companies such as Veolia in the energy sector of Ireland
A board member of Veolia stated in the past:In an increasingly environmentally sensitive marketplace, water is seen as a strategic asset which needs to be managed appropriately
This reality has prompted Veolia to develop a new metric [system] to help industry and local authority [areas] alike to grasp the obvious and hidden cost of water so they can make sustainable business decisions while ensuring long-term profitability
Why does this board have no environmental campaigners or persons outside academic circles with expertise in the area of promoting sustainability? I am also concerned about the proposed name change for the CER to reflect the economical management of water
The CER facilitates competition in the energy industry; I argue that it seeks to limit the role of State companies and help the private sector in the interests of competition
Would its role in the water sector be similar in theory? Is this to facilitate its role in encouraging future charges and private companies to enter the water industry? Considering the very strong opposition in this country to any attempt to introduce water charges or the prospect of water services privatisation and the attempts to make a commodity of a precious resource like water, can the Minister understand these small, slight changes ring alarm bells for people that the SEAI is full of businesspeople who in past lives were concerned with making money from water services or oil exploration? Also of concern is the idea that an energy regulator that in the past facilitated private interests in making money from energy generation will now be tasked with encouraging the same competition and profit-making in water services
I also want to comment on the biofuels obligation levy and what seems to be, again, a minor accountancy change in how the National Oil Reserves Agency, NORA, deals with the companies under the scheme
It is worth pointing to how the scheme, despite its supposed green credentials, actually wiped out many of the small indigenous firms involved in the biofuels sector in Ireland
It was introduced in 2011 by my colleague, Deputy Eamon Ryan, who claimed it would allow "the market
to find the most efficient way of delivering the volumes of bio-fuel to the market, minimising the effect on consumers and the Exchequer
" The market found the most efficient way to deliver profits for some firms, but it did little to put it on the road towards the sustainable and indigenous use of biofuels
The scheme favoured big industry and the importation of biofuels by larger companies and firms
Some 78% of liquid biofuels were imported in 2013
Nothing in the Bill will help to change this or see us invest in a serious manner to produce biofuels locally
Despite some guarantees, the switch to biofuels internationally is having a huge impact on the developing world's poorest, resulting in land grabs and rising food prices in commodities on which poor people depend
Even with a large proportion of transport fuels now comprising biofuels, it has not seen any decline in the overall volume of oil, etc
, used; therefore, there has been no reduction in CO2 levels in Ireland
Ireland is still not on target to decarbonise or reduce CO2 emissions
We are already woefully behind in meeting the targets we need to reach to decarbonise the economy in terms of the investment in renewable energy sources and power generation and to hit our commitments under the Paris Declaration
Is the Minister not concerned about the lack of ambition or vision in the Bill which proposes changes to the energy sector in this country? It is amazing that an energy Bill is brought to the Dáil that does not hint at the serious, catastrophic consequences of climate change and shows no real innovation in how we should tackle this issue, other than making slight changes to the board of the SEAI and the manner in which we audit biofuel use
On the public service obligation, an issue on which Deputy Thomas P
Broughan touched, it is quite extraordinary that in 2011 the levy was €19
33, excluding VAT
It currently stands at €60 which the commission wants to hike to €90, including VAT
There has been an increase of 40% in the past four years
John-Mark McCafferty, head of social justice and policy with the Society of St
Vincent de Paul, said:With VAT added domestic customers are effectively paying a tax on a tax
In the interest of social justice and fairness, we urge a review of the PSO application for low income and struggling energy customers
The PSO levy is a tax with which the Government orchestrates its energy policy and amounts to €40 million per year which goes to subsidise many private companies in the industry
I hope the Minister will take this on board
I am pro-European, pro-solidarity and pro co-operation
Much has been said in the corporate media that those with a different position on the future of the European Union are somehow lining themselves up with regressive forces and elements of the far right
I utterly reject that argument
Members of this House, who try to associate AAA-PBP with views from far right parties and abhorrent nationalist parties, are politically illiterate and opportunistic in their language
Our solidarity and co-operation goes out to the working people of England, Wales, Scotland, the North of Ireland and far beyond
Regardless of how they voted, I have more in common with working people from these geographical areas than the technocrats and sociopaths of the European banking system
Working people regardless of where they are living on these islands have absolutely nothing in common with the British Tories or Nigel Farage, MEP, and his band of narrow-minded reactionaries
They have nothing to offer but to uphold their deep class prejudice and the economic system from which they thrive
Some commentators have painted whole swathes of working class communities in England as reactionary and xenophobic
To me this skews the debate on why people chose to reject the European Union
These are areas that were once heartlands of the old industrial working class and of the British labour movement
By and large they remain Labour Party strongholds which suffered devastation under the Thatcher regime
It is a matter of undeniable fact that fears of immigration and racism were a running narrative in the debate on either remaining in or leaving the EU
However, the question is whether that was the main element
Many of the towns that typically and decisively voted to leave are safe Labour seats
Bradford, for example, voted by 54
2% to 45
8% to leave
Bradford is a city with a large Asian population
It has three parliamentary constituencies and three Labour MPs
Each of these Labour MPs won big majorities in 2015
Bolsover is another example
It has been represented for decades by the Labour MP, Denis Skinner, with a huge majority
Bolsover voted by 70
8% to leave the European Union
I wish to raise something others have not mentioned, which is the relationship between the European Union and the state of Israel
I will read out some pretty abhorrent facts
EU arms sales to Israel in 2014 were worth nearly €2 billion
Germany is the leading supplier of weapons and military equipment from the EU to Israel, with sales of up to €1 billion in 2014
A submarine armed with cruise missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads was sold by Germany to Israel for €7 billion in December of last year
Other equipment sold by the EU to Israel includes warships, aircraft, military vehicles, tanks, weapons, firing equipment, explosive devices, imaging and electronic equipment, chemical agents, small arms and artillery
Israel's weapons sales to Europe more than doubled in 2015 by comparison with the previous year
According to official figures released by the Israeli defence ministry, arms worth $1
6 billion were exported in 2015
This compares with arms exports of $724 million in 2014
Most of Israel's arms sales are exports of ammunition, drones and other upgrades to existing aircraft
Even though Israel killed 2,000 civilians, including 560 children, in the Gaza Strip in 2014, the EU continues to sell arms that destroy lives, rather than saving them, to that country in large numbers
The European Union has for long periods been portrayed as a benign force in Irish society
Many people still see it as a progressive institution
I believe that relationship is now being questioned more than ever before
The economic meltdown of 2008 changed our relationship with the EU forever
I remind the House that 42% of the cost of the crisis in Europe's banking system is being paid by Ireland
That equates to €9,000 per citizen of this country
Ireland finds itself in an economic straitjacket as a result of Fianna Fáil's bankrupt policies, which were perpetuated by the European banking system
This is an affront to democracy and progress in a social Europe
The people have spoken
They have said that they want a social Europe rather than a corporate Europe
It is raining money
We already paid for it
I do not normally interrupt
I apologise
It is incredible
They are all in denial
Extraordinary
The Minister might wish to leave the Chamber or put his fingers in his ears
What I am going to read out would shock anybody
I will just give the facts
I will remind everybody in this House how much taxpayers’ money has been spent on Irish Water thus far
Some €585 million has been spent on water meter installation and €86 million was spent on consultants by early January 2014
Some 300 Irish Water staff were paid bonuses averaging €7,000 at a total of € 2
1 million
Some €166 million has gone to the water conservation grant and administration costs have been €6 million
In 2014, Irish Water received a State subvention of €439 million and was expected to receive €399 million and €479 million in 2015 and 2016 respectively
Two thirds of this money came from motor tax payments and some 30% of the local property tax revenue collected in 2014 was also diverted to Irish Water
The taxpayer will have given close to €3 billion to Irish Water by the end of 2016
It gets worse
Some €316,948 has been spent on four public relations firms
The customer service contact centre has cost €17 million and it has cost €820,000 to send Irish Water bills to members of the public
The figures show that the latest billing cycle, covering January, February and March, is costing 61 cent per paper bill
Irish Water paid out more than €3
7 million in fees to external consultants to provide it with expert services between March and August 2015 alone, including €740,748 to legal firm A & L Goodbody, €217,000 to McCann Fitzgerald, €130,000 to Arthur Cox and more than €470,000 to Ernst and Young Ireland, while accounting and consultancy firm KPMG received about €120,000
To say this has been a complete fiasco is an understatement
The sight of the former Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, and now EU Commissioner, Phil Hogan, gloating that he would turn non-payers of water to a trickle was as nauseating back then as it now
His arrogance and utter contempt said everything about the former Administration
Thankfully, the contempt and arrogance of Mr
Hogan created a groundswell of popular protest and civil disobedience to create the biggest mass movement of the State's history
Like many elected Deputies in this House, I was extremely proud to be part of this great social movement
One of the extraordinary aspects of this whole fiasco has been the role of the Labour Party
My family always voted for the Labour Party
I was told growing up that they stood up for the working person and represented their values
The sight of Labour Party Ministers being apologists for Fine Gael policy and acting as the cheerleaders of the debacle of Irish Water was as nauseating and arrogant as Mr
Hogan's comments
People will ask where they were on 11 October 2014
I know where I was, like 160,000 other people
Everything changed on that day
It may have been an ordinary autumnal Saturday, but this day will go down in Irish history as the day when the people decided they had simply had enough
The Taoiseach was right about one thing during this fiasco, namely, that this was more than just about water
It was about everything that had gone on in the previous six years when working people took the pain and trauma of the greed of the few
The people have spoken and they have utterly rejected not only water charges, but the Government which imposed them
This independent commission is a euphemism for an exit strategy for this Government to save face
The Government has been humiliated by the very people it tried to humiliate over the past five years
In conclusion, I am reminded of the great slogan, "The power of the people is much stronger than the people in power"
How true this is
The political establishment in this country seems to think it has an automatic right to rule
More than ever before, the political establishment has been challenged and questioned not only in this Chamber, but in society as a whole
Things will never be the same again
Strangely enough, I received the Minister of State's response earlier on
It is a bit chaotic here because I was supposed to speak at 3
I was looking over the Minister of State's response and was listening to her when she was verbally responding
It is probably slightly misleading because I was just looking up the SIPTU average hourly rate for child care workers and it is €9
If a person is earning that, he or she will probably earn €380 per week for a very important job
I was at a major protest outside the Dáil about a year and a half ago about child care workers who have been so badly paid
There is a huge turnover of child care workers
The Government said that it would address it and so forth
From my research on this, Ireland had the highest cost of child care in the OECD but I do not know the position at this moment
It is a very important industry
It came into the news about two years ago because of the turnover of workers as well as job practice and employment legislation
I do not know if the Minister of State can comment on that

This is my first time speaking during Leaders' Questions, so I will probably go easy on the Taoiseach
Many people in this House have received correspondence and e-mails in regard to bin charges and that whole debacle
I just want to read out one e-mail I got from a chap in the area I live in
I cut it down a little bit
It encapsulates everything that is wrong with these charges:I want to raise this issue of the new pay-by-weight bin charges announced by Greyhound and other bin companies
I am a full-time carer for my sister, who has Downs syndrome and who suffers from adult urinary incontinence
I need to use my bin daily to dispose of adult nappies and pads
As a result of the new charges, my bin charges will increase from Euro 204 to Euro 304
This is a price increase of 50% and in my opinion it is outrageous that this is allowed to happen
] The Dept of Environment stated that 87% of clients would see their bin charges fall
This is clearly erroneous and misleading information
I am a life-long environmentalist and I have a compost heap for my green waste
I use my green bin to dispose of all plastics and paper
There is very little else I can do to reduce my own personal liability
I hope you can now influence this Government to step in before July 1st and prevent this profiteering by these bin companies
I never thought I would end up in the Dáil
But I am very proud to represent working people and one poster has stuck in my head for a very long time
It read, "We deserve to live, not just to exist", and that is what is happening to working people in this country at the moment
We talk about a dispensation in this House but there is a dispensation in society whereby working people will not take any more stealth taxes or fiascos such as Irish Water
What is the Taoiseach going to do about this debacle? Will he bring forward legislation to ensure it does not happen again?
I do not think people are looking for a gentleman's agreement
This gentleman is with Greyhound but that company is exempt from the new charges and is not a part of the Irish Waste Management Association
This man has to stay with his provider so he cannot be exempt from any new charges
I remember when the service was in public control, maybe ten or 12 years ago, but I do not remember any fly tipping, or at any rate it was very rare
Now it is almost contagious across the country and there is a correlation between that and the privatisation of the public refuse service
It will cost local authorities around the country millions and millions to clean it up
This service should not be privatised - it should be in public hands
Can you address the issue of Greyhound? Greyhound is exempt-----

Will the Minister for Defence provide details of the oversight by Dáil Éireann of a participation of Irish troops in a British-led EU battle group in May 2016, and will he make a statement on the matter?
I find the term battle group unsettling
I do not think it appropriate phraseology for a peacekeeping troop
On 18 May, Irish troops participated in the EU battle group
They spent 18 days doing war games on Salisbury Plain
To me, that compromises Irish neutrality
Ireland is meant to be neutral of any aggression
This is NATO-lite
Our troops should not be involved in any acts of aggression around the world
We should pull out of these battle groups, or whatever one might want to call them, because they are a
Perhaps the Minister of State could indicate if he knows how many Irish troops took part in the war games on Salisbury Plain? I find it very unsettling that Irish troops are conducting these kinds of military exercise
I do not know if the Minister of State knows precisely how many troops were involved
Is the Minister of State aware of the war games that took place in-----

It is bizarre that-----

I congratulate the Minister on his new post

The crisis in the health service is universally accepted as a fact, and with good reason
Waiting lists and trolley queues are not a seasonal aberration but a permanent fixture
The state of mental health service staffing, after ten years of A Vision for Change, is a national scandal
It is extraordinary that the Government’s acceptance of this crisis is still in doubt
The publication of the Revised Estimates for health shows that the Government, which has presided over the health crisis over the past five years, seems to be still stuck in denial
During the past five years, the Fine Gael mantra was “more for less”
First James Reilly and then Deputy Leo Varadkar expected us to believe the cutbacks in health funding would do no harm
A child could have predicted this
Patient support groups and staff representatives told the Government about the devastating effects of austerity cuts on patient care
All of this advice fell on deaf ears
Less service for less funding would have been bad enough
However, Fine Gael wanted to introduce the market and the private, for-profit sector, which is its answer for everything, and we got even less service for more money
As a result of the additional €5 billion spent on health insurance and out-of-pocket expenses, Ireland has ended up with health spending that is above the EU average and quality that is below the EU average
We get less for more, not more for less
Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have misled the country about our health service and they continue to do so
All through its time in government, Fine Gael lectured the left on costing, insisting that the figures for alternative health proposals did not add up
Meanwhile, it never costed its flagship health policy of universal health insurance, UHI
Fine Gael introduced this UHI policy of private, for-profit health insurance in 2009 as FairCare
It announced it as policy in the Fine Gael 2011 election manifesto and the programme for Government
However, when it finally outlined the policy in a White Paper three years later, in 2014, it still had not costed it and could not say how much the health insurance would cost or what it would cover
I doubt Fine Gael has learned a lesson from this
The approximately €500 million increase in the health budget announced in the Revised Estimates is almost entirely consumed by current real spending in health
This is not an overrun as the Government claims
In 2008, eight years ago, the health budget was the same, €13
6 billion, as it is today after the so-called additional money
Inflation in the same period was cumulatively more than 30% and the population is increasing in number and in age
This means there is less spending on health care than ever before
The smoke and mirrors of health funding continues
While the overall budget increases by just 6% year-on-year, the Minister has increased spending on consultancy fees in his Department by a whopping 96%
Given the level of public concern and outcry about the neglect of mental health services, the Minister’s failure to address mental health is amazing
Staffing of mental health is only three quarters what it should be and only half the recommended level for children’s mental health services
Despite this, while the overall budget has increased by 6% the mental health budget has increased by only 2%
In the Revised Estimates, the €35 million noted as not yet allocated for new developments in mental health is described as additional funding
However, even when it is added in, the total is no more than the general increase in the health budget
The level of funding in mental health is only half what it should be, based on international comparisons, resulting in a deficit of €800 million
While the announcement of developments in primary care, speech and language and psychology services is welcome and overdue, it is dismaying that no specific funding or staffing targets are addressed
While Fine Gael recently said it is committed to developing a one-tier, publicly funded health service, confidence is not inspired by the failure to be honest about deficits in capacity, staff, hospital beds and primary care centres
Continued talk of superficial fixes through buying and selling care in the National Treatment Purchase Fund and the setting up of hospital trusts can only lead public representatives, such as us, to conclude that Fine Gael, supported by Fianna Fáil, is still up to its old tricks
It is time for the Minister to stop running and spinning the numbers and address the staffing and funding crisis in the health service
In a debate on EU battle groups last year, the then Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, stated:Ireland's traditional policy of military neutrality is unaffected by our participation
We are not and will not become part of any military alliance or permanent military formation
We will not enter into any mutual defence arrangement
How then do we explain Ireland's membership of the EU battle group or our partnership with NATO? Fine Gael, supported by Fianna Fáil, further ensured the Dáil that any deployment of an Irish contribution as part of the German battle group will be subject to the triple lock of the Government, the Dáil and a UN mandate before deployment occurs
How do we explain the fact that in May this year  Ireland should withdraw from the EU battle groups, NATO partnerships including the use of Shannon by the US, and, as Denmark has done, from further participation in US militarisation
It is good we are having this debate because this issue affects everybody, regardless of who they are and where in the country they live
The perpetual crisis of our health system mirrors the glaring inequalities of society in Ireland today
According to public health experts, health outcomes and our general well-being are deeply affected by inequality in income and inequality in access to health services
Access to health care when needed is a fundamental human right
From the moment we are born, in the course of life's challenges, somewhere along the way we will all need a health system that takes cares of us at our time of need
The Department of Health has been compared to Angola but even Angola managed to dig up its landmines and find a peace settlement to resolve the bitter civil conflict that ravaged that country
The recent report by the Irish Cancer Society that waiting times for life-saving tests for cancer patients are up to 25 times longer for public patients than for those paying privately is distressing and shocking
The report highlighted striking differences between access for public patients and private patients, with GPs reporting that some public patients have to wait up to 480 days for an ultrasound
That means waiting for well over a year for a cancer investigation
The report also quoted an Irish College of General Practitioners report that delays in accessing diagnostics force many patients to pay for scans and tests privately to secure diagnosis and as a result, a patient's ability to pay is linked to his or her ability to access diagnostics used to detect cancer in a timely manner
The report gets to the heart of what is wrong with our health system
I would go even further and state that this way of dealing with cancer patients amounts to negligence and a violation of a basic human right to health care
In its crudest form, those with the ability to pay can skip the queue and access early intervention for cancer and a better life outcome
Health care should not be about queueing for years
It should not be about how big a person's wallet is
It should be about the delivery of universal health care that is not based on someone's ability to pay or any discrimination based on income or social class
If it was any other form of discrimination, such as based on ethnicity or sexual orientation, this health system loophole would have been quite rightly closed down by now
It is no coincidence that successive right-wing Governments, led by Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael, have created a two-tier health system
Both parties have applied the logic of the market to water, housing, transport and health
For them profit always comes first even if, such as in the tragic death of Susie Long, patients die waiting
Another example of Government failure in early intervention in our health service is waiting times for children with special needs
According to the reply to a parliamentary question I tabled a number of weeks ago, the average waiting time in Dublin Mid-West for a speech and language therapist is 12 to 18 months and for an occupational therapist it is 18 months to two years
These waiting times are only for assessment and do not include the further wait for treatment
This is clearly unacceptable
Children cannot be routinely expected to wait more than half their lives for intervention that needs to be made as early as possible
Inclusion Ireland has stated that Ireland is in breach of the recommended number of children who should be assigned to each speech and language therapist
It commented that the recommended caseload size is 30 to 65 children per therapist but in Ireland the national average is an unbelievable 162 children per therapist
To meet international standards, the number of speech and language therapists working in children's disability services would have to be tripled from its current level of 283 speech and language therapists to 800
Inclusion Ireland and other agencies report that, increasingly, hard-pressed families are incurring financial hardship by having to pay for services they cannot access through the public system
It is good that we are having this debate about the Irish health service
I hope that by adopting this motion we will make a start at abolishing the two-tier health service that is not fit for purpose
I have worked in the health service for the past 16 years
I know that the fault does not lie with the staff who are very dedicated and extremely professional in what they do
Most people will say that when they use the health service, their experience of front-line staff is incredibly positive
Having gone through numerous pay cuts and cutbacks in the past eight years, it is a testament to the dedication of health service staff that we have a functional health service
Ireland spends more on our two-tier health service than any other European country but we do not get as good a service as countries which spend more on public health services and less on private services
It is time to move away from profiteering and away from buying and selling health care for profit and follow the international evidence that one-tier publicly funded not-for-profit health care is best by far
As the Minister knows, Mr
Halawa has been in prison for the last 1,000 days, which is over three years, without trial
His continuing mistreatment is completely unacceptable and is causing his family untold stress
While there are probably moves going on in the background by the Government to try to get Mr
Halawa released, at this stage the Taoiseach needs to intervene and talk to his counterparts in Egypt
It is not acceptable that after 1,000 days Mr
Halawa is still locked up without trial
Basically, he has been interned
We should do all we can to get this innocent man freed
It is like the Irish people who were locked up in Britain - they committed no crime
They were just in the wrong place at the wrong time
Hopefully, Mr
Halawa can be out very soon
I thank the Minister
What is worrying is Egypt's diabolical justice system
Currently, 492 individuals are awaiting a mass trial and Ibrahim is one of them
Even the EU has rightly criticised Egypt's record on selective justice, because it is slightly archaic
I understand the Government is trying to do its best to free him but I reiterate that if there is no conclusion by the end of June in his case, the Taoiseach should intervene directly
By any stretch of the imagination, Israel is not a normal state
Its very existence was born out of brutality and racism
As such, we should treat it as an abnormal state
People might be surprised by how much trade we do with Israel, particularly in the arms industry
Since 2005, Ireland has spent €15 million on military imports from Israel and has sold €6
5 million of military dual use hardware to the state of Israel since 2011
People might be surprised by that but what will shock them to their very being is that in 2014 in the war in Gaza, Israel murdered 1,700 civilians
Of those 1,700 civilians, 551 were children
How are we trading with a country like that?
I should be allowed to reply

We are all God's children, as the saying goes
It is with great pleasure that I support this motion to abolish water charges and Irish Water, and to call for a referendum to safeguard water resources by securing them in public ownership
I am here today in no small part due to the historic water charges movement which demolished the Fine Gael Government's attempt to privatise the water service
From the beginning, Fine Gael shaped Irish Water as the precursor to a for-profit private enterprise
It did not want a utility that would provide clean and safe water efficiently
It did not want to fix the antiquated water infrastructure
It did not want to conserve water or limit the amount of treated water used
It just wanted to set up a billing operation so that when payments were successfully forced on the population, it would be ripe for selling off to the highest bidder
We can see this in the order of the party's priorities
Did we see Fine Gael quickly move to fix and replace pipes or to upgrade water and sewage treatment plants? Did we see it roll out grants to retrofit water-saving devices and plumbing in peoples' homes? Instead, we saw the scandal of paying millions to consultants, the introduction of expensive billing procedures, but most of all, there was an attempt to try to force meters onto every home in Ireland to ensure the money started flowing, whatever about the water
The masses of Irish people who made sacrifices to bail out the banking system had simply had enough
They were weary but determined that they would defeat the Government by protesting against the installation of water meters, by refusing to pay the charges as double taxation and by taking to the streets in their tens and hundreds of thousands in demonstrations up and down the country
The collapse in income for Irish Water, a fall of 21% in the last quarter, shows that the retreat of the Government has turned into a rout, as those who were coerced into paying have joined the boycott and also refused to pay
While the Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael parties have threatened to pursue people for unpaid water bills, the reality is that those are uncollectible debts for money squandered on overpaid consultants and useless meters
Instead, we should consider pursuing the former Ministers, Phil Hogan, and Deputy Alan Kelly, for recklessly wasting the money poured down the Irish Water drain over the past five years
Water charge bills and penalties should now be cancelled and those who have paid should be reimbursed with an apology for any duress
One of the greatest social movements in history has shaped the political landscape forever
The voice of people power is clear, as is their victory
We should abolish Irish Water and abolish the water charges
I was elected by the people of Dublin Mid-West as a voice against the ideology of austerity
Austerity seeks to punish collectively the working people of this country for the greed of a few
That few, who caused financial and economic chaos, thought they had got away with the perfect robbery
They almost did, until the people of Ireland rose up against the imposition of water charges
Deputy Enda Kenny was right when he said this was about more than just water
The water charges were everything that is wrong with a system that makes the working people of Ireland, who got us out of the financial mess over recent years, pay for it again
To make no bones about it, Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Labour Party have brought untold misery on working people in Ireland over the past eight years
This Administration, like the previous two Governments, will continue with the same neoliberal agenda
I have seen how people have been demoralised and beaten down by the Government's policies
I will give one example
The Government said it would reduce the waiting time for emergency departments in hospitals, but there is no commitment to reduce the waiting lists for non-emergency procedures
I have met people who are waiting for years for operations
If one belongs to the 40% of the Irish population who are on medical cards, one will wait 125 days for an MRI scan
By then, the cancer cells might have grown to dangerous levels
In contrast, if one has the money, one can pay for a private MRI scan within six days
With early detection, one's chances of survival dramatically increase
Those shocking figures show how Ireland’s two-tier health system leads to the earlier deaths of poorer people
In Britain the NHS guidelines state that a suspected cancer patient should be seen by a specialist within two weeks
In other words, he or she must get an MRI scan and meet a specialist long before an Irish patient is even diagnosed
The total failure to provide for early detection in the Irish public health system is one of the reasons poorer people die earlier
A recent study by the Irish Council for General Practitioners found that cancer related deaths in the lower socioeconomic groups are double those among higher socioeconomic groups
The programme for Government will not change that one iota
Today is the first day a Fine Gael Taoiseach has been re-elected, but that re-election is a hollow victory
Essentially, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have now merged and have been soundly defeated by a popular movement never seen in the history of the State
The water charges movement brought the best out of people
It brought people together and gave them confidence not only in themselves but in their communities
It politicised them and made them question everything about what was wrong in politics in this country
It gave us hope and gave the voiceless a voice
I want the Government to take note that a sleeping giant has awoken and is never going to sleep again
There is a new resurgence of militancy in working class communities throughout Ireland and they are more organised than was previously the case
If there is one thing we can all agree on, it is that climate change is a clear and present danger
Though it may seem abstract and far away at times, climate change increasingly brings reality home to everyone's lives, with heavy rainfall, storms and floods causing distress and dislocation in people's lives
In her book,  What does this mean for Ireland? Is our priority the rich and powerful or the interests of the people who live here? Combatting climate change requires reducing the amount of carbon dioxide we release through human activities
In construction, reducing our expenditure on heating by improving insulation reduces both carbon emissions and heating bills
New designs for houses with better insulation and heating systems, known as passive houses, can reduce bills to under €200 a year for the average house
However, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government has instead demanded that local authorities delete all references to passive houses in their development plans
Incredibly, at the request of the Construction Industry Federation and the building lobby, the Minister, Deputy Kelly, gutted proposals to make the passive house the standard in all newly built homes
Instead of human needs and interests, profits and the market were put first
In transport, the National Transport Authority has also focused on promoting competition rather than increasing public transport's capacity to cater for the massive shift we need away from cars and onto buses, trams and trains
Policy seems more geared towards facilitating giant transport multinationals such as Transdev and Arriva than on our transport needs or environment
Piecemeal investments in housing and transport will not deliver the kind of change needed to cut carbon emissions
What is needed is a national transport and housing strategy that provides both high quality service and low emissions
In Ireland, agriculture accounts for 29% of all emissions but after the excuses given by the Taoiseach at the Paris climate conference in December it seems that big business and the beef barons were calling the shots
According to the Environmental Protection Agency, "Overall it is evident
that Ireland is not on track towards decarbonising the economy
and will face steep challenges
unless further policies and measures are put in place
" People Before Profit believes that we should massively increase our forests, nationalise all of the State's gas and oil fields, ban fracking and use all of the State's natural resources to switch the economy to a carbon neutral basis as soon as practically possibly
We support the taxing of corporate profits to fund the switch to renewable forms of energy generation and investing in wave, solar and wind power generation
Out of consideration for those who will inherit the earth, it is imperative that we leave it as we found it
I believe it is not the presence of human beings on the earth that is causing grave harm to our beautiful planet but the system that has put profits before people and profits before the environment
Until we challenge the system, there is a stopwatch on all of us and our time is running out
I am glad we are having this debate because no family in Ireland has not been affected by mental health issues
Our sense of mental well-being and contentment is one of the most important attributes that we have in society
Since the economic crisis in 2008, however, austerity has wreaked social havoc
It is not only bad for one's pocket or job prospects but for one's physical and mental health
The Growing Up in Ireland study published last year showed that the stress of unemployment and poverty, caused by cuts in services and incomes, had damaged parents' mental health and had knock-on effects on their children's mental health
The stress of low pay and a lack of access to affordable housing, child care and health care have only added to this distress
I know this at first hand, having been a county councillor for the past seven years
Mental health difficulties affect more than 500,000 people in Ireland
We have the highest suicide rate in Europe among teenage girls and the second highest among boys
Suicide is the number one killer of young people between the ages of 16 and 24
Instead of supporting young people, however, the Government targeted them through cuts in their jobseeker's allowance as well as cuts in new entrants' pay, which disproportionately affects young people and young parents with children
I welcome that the stigma around mental health, in particular regarding young men, has been challenged recently
We are all vulnerable at times to life's challenges and nobody is immune to bouts of desperation and feelings of hopelessness
We all would like to think that at a time of need for ourselves and our family and friends, essential services, such as in mental health, will be there when we need them most
However, staffing in mental health services has been cut by 10% in the years of austerity
For adult services, staff levels are only three quarters of what is recommended by the Department of Health
For children's services, it is even worse, with only half of the staff required in place
Children often wait more than a year to be seen
In emergencies, they find themselves on adult psychiatric wards because there are no beds in children's wards
Early intervention is key to treating people with mental health issues
In the words of the Psychiatric Nurses Association, PNA: "For someone with mental health issues the riverbank, cliff top or shoreline is not the place to offer comfort and support
Intervention should be a much earlier stage
" Where people finally get access to mental health services, the lack of funding for psychological and social therapies has led to an over-reliance on the use of medication
The HSE's counselling in primary care service receives tens of thousands of referrals each year but less than 1% of mental health funding
The recent cut of €12 million in the mental health budget shows that the Government is deaf to this pain and suffering
The budget of almost €800 million is widely condemned as being at only half the level that it should be and the Minister's mean-spirited cut of €12 million shows how out of touch he is with the gaping hole in mental health services
Recent social research shows that in countries where there is greater inequality and where people have less control over their lives and work, there are more mental health and social problems
Redistributing wealth by taxing the richest 1% would reduce inequality and provide funding for support services
While things can seem bleak at times, there is hope, and hope can come in many guises
There are many positive and important initiatives taking place every day in communities and clinics around the country to help people to access help, cope with and, hopefully, recover from mental health difficulties
People Before Profit calls on the Government to tax the rich to reduce inequality and fund public services, including a doubling of the mental health budget
To help relieve the social causes of distress, we advocate an increase in the direct provision of public service jobs, housing and welfare and pay rises for workers across the private and public sectors
We support the PNA's proposal for a strike to protest the crisis in staffing levels
Front-line staff in mental health services are some of the most dedicated workers in the health service
The erosion of their pay and conditions has had a detrimental effect on them
Social solidarity is the true hope for the future of all our mental health
Yes and I do not think I will be heckled
I hope not
Will the Ceann Comhairle give me some extra time? This will take about five minutes
As a care assistant for the past 16 years, the best education I ever got in life was working with the wonderful people I was lucky enough to care for
Sometimes the people in my care were coming to the end of their lives, while others were beginning a long and arduous journey of convalescence and rehabilitation
This gratifying work and life experience, making a positive contribution to people facing life's most serious challenges will always shape my outlook on life
Equally, I will always admire the amazing dedication of my fellow workers, auxiliary staff, nurses and doctors
I very much doubt that any Minister for Health personally likes to see people on trolleys in accident and emergency departments, struggling to get home care packages or waiting for vital operations
However, it is the result of the cruel and unjust political choices of the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government and previous Governments that we find ourselves in this perennial and prolonged crisis in our health service
The issue I want to raise is that of home help services and the 1 million home help hours that have been cut by the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government since 2011
The Fianna Fáil-Green Party Government had already cut 1 million hours of home help to bail out the banks but the Fine Gael-Labour Government continued with the cuts, attacking some of the most vulnerable workers who look after some of our most vulnerable citizens
Those home care cuts have had a serious and detrimental effect, not only on the recipients of care but also on carers themselves
It is estimated that every year up to 75,000 people need to avail of home help services but, according to the HSE, only 21,000 people are currently benefiting from some sort of package and the number of home care hours will fall by 50,000 this year
As the Government is well aware, the demand for home care packages and home care hours is growing every year because of our ageing population
Cuts to home care packages are not, as is often claimed, a cost-saving exercise
They also serve the Government’s ideological commitment to for-profit provision by private companies
That is a policy of privatisation of public health care and home care
At present there are 50 private for-profit home care providers in Ireland
This market is worth €330 million
These are highly profitable companies that get contracts worth millions of euro per year from the HSE
On the other hand, the salaries of the care workers who actually provide the care average from €10 to €11 an hour while their employer charges over €26 an hour, more than double what the carer gets
This level of profiteering is a waste of public funding and it is it is a shame and a scandal that so many are left without care
Professor Des O'Neill of Tallaght hospital recently described the cuts to home care as “totally bonkers and self-defeating”
He added "It will cause significant personal distress for frail older people who are prevented from being able to go home in a timely and supported manner, and will also have significant consequences for an already over-loaded hospital system
" Professor O’Neill’s sentiments are shared by the majority of health and social care staff, carers and those requiring care
In an age when people would prefer to stay at home rather than have successive and needless stays in hospital, surely we should be funding home care packages as a priority
We need to respect and value the work done by care workers and carers
We need to put an end to the "care-cramming" that forces home care workers to race against the clock through unreasonable time allocations and which places those vulnerable citizens being cared for at risk of injury
The position in respect of home care is, like those relating to many other social services - such as housing, health care and water supply - in a state of ongoing crisis
Measures urgently required are: employ more care workers in properly paid, permanent jobs with adequate training and support; stop the privatisation of our health system through expensive contracts with for-profit companies; provide medical cards as a minimum to all those receiving long-term care; abolish means testing for carers and improve their carer’s allowance payments and other supports; and publish and fund phase 2 of the national care strategy, setting out a clear plan for carers from 2016 to 2020
