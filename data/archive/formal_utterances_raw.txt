A HOST OF new TDs will take their seats in the 32nd Dáil today and among them will be Gino Kenny, the new Anti Austerity Alliance-People Before Profit deputy for Dublin Mid-West
He will arrive at Leinster House this morning having taken the 151 bus from his native Neilstown in Clondalkin
On other days he said he’ll cycle the 11 kilometres into town
No car and absolutely no fuss
He describes himself as a “normal working person” who represents working class people, and that’s very much apparent from his demeanour
In some ways, Kenny comes across as a reluctant TD
He doesn’t like to use the word politician, preferring to describe himself as a “shop steward on a factory floor”
As for wearing a suit? No chance
He owns one, but it’s only for weddings
“I’m not against suits
For myself, I don’t feel comfortable in suits, I have to say,” the soft-spoken former community care worker told TheJournal
ie this week
“Personally I just wear… look respectable
I think sometimes the stereotype about politicians is a suit and a big car and that’s not me
I cycle and walk and I get the bus in
I suppose, for want of a better word, I’m just a normal working person that wants to represent working people and that’s what I want
Kenny was elected in Dublin Mid-West after years of campaigning and working on the ground
He previously ran unsuccessfully for People Before Profit in the 2007 and 2011 general elections
But this time it was different
He took the last of four seats with just under 8,000 votes on the 12th count last month
The huge swathe of anger over water charges and other issues, particularly housing according to Kenny, saw the Labour vote “obliterated” and AAA-PBP capitalised
Kenny, who was christened Eugene, is the first TD for Neilstown, an area he’s spent most of his life in
“I was born in 1972
I was raised in Islandbridge flats and then we moved from Islandbridge flats in 1979 to Neilstown
So I’ve been living there ever since, in Clondalkin,” he said
“In the 1980s, when a lot of people were put out to Neilstown, there was very little infrastructure
Then it became bigger and bigger and there was certain problems that materialised because there was nothing to do for young people
Then drugs kind of took hold, heroin took hold and it caused absolute chaos
Kenny said his own family has not been immune to the heroin epidemic
He has lost friends to the drug, while others have moved out of the area, but Neilstown, he added, is a “much better place to live in and work in these days”
It’s not without its problems though, including the lack of social housing with many families forced to live in hotels or worse
Kenny has identified it as his number one priority in the new Dáil
“There are people living in hotels for over a year-and-a-half, people on the waiting list for the last ten years,” he said
“I mean before if you [had to be] socially housed it was an average of about seven years wait, no more than that
Now it could be anything between 10 to 12 years
It’s a crisis beyond the crisis, it should be declared a national emergency
Kenny said the government is too focussed on getting the private market to build houses when there needs to be a “massive build of social houses” over the next five years
But what can one of six AAA-PBP TDs in the new Dáil do about it given they’ll be in opposition? Kenny drew comparisons with the water charges movement
“Six activists in the Dáil is one thing but it’s mobilising as many different people on different issues – from water charges to property tax, the housing issue – on to the streets
To us, that’s what counts
People power is ultimately gonna change things and mould things in society
Kenny said he is humbled by the position he is in after three attempts at winning election to the Dáil
Now he will try to give the people who elected him the best representation he can
His quiet and reserved disposition leads you to believe he will not be as bombastic as his PBP colleague Richard Boyd-Barrett or as divisive as AAA’s Paul Murphy
“People need a voice politically and I think I’m very humbled and very honoured to be in that position, to represent working people of the constituency, not only the constituency but nationally,” he said
That’s what drives me, all the injustices that go on in Ireland
Hopefully we can, politically, try to address them

The author of the Bill to introduce medicinal cannabis in the Republic has said he still smokes the drug recreationally and has experimented with other substances in the past
People Before Profit TD Gino Kenny’s Private Member’s Bill on the medicinal use of cannabis was passed in the Dáil without a vote earlier in December
It is due to go to committee stage in February
In an interview with Hot Press magazine, Mr Kenny (44) has said he did not realise the impact the Bill was going to have, and that he occasionally smokes cannabis recreationally
“I don’t smoke [cigarettes] and I’m very health-conscious,” he said
“I’d smoke a joint the odd time
The last time I smoked a joint was probably about four months ago
“If people want to smoke a joint, it’s their business
It’s not a cardinal sin because you had a bleeding joint
Mr Kenny also said he had experimented with drugs such as ecstasy “over time” during the 1990s
“I mean, TDs are probably no different from a whole section of society – you know, the drugs and alcohol they might take,” he said
Overwhelmed by public response
On the reaction to his Bill passing the first stage in the Dáil, Mr Kenny said he had been overwhelmed by the public response
“I didn’t realise the impact it was going to have,” he said
“The emails that I’ve got from people that it will affect, or are using cannabis, are just extraordinary
Amazing
Hopefully, at the end of this process, medical cannabis will be in some form legalised in Ireland
It will give people an option
Mr Kenny, who worked as a carer for the elderly in several hospitals before becoming a politician, also discussed a number of other issues in the interview, including his wish to see euthanasia legally available in Ireland
Of US president-elect Donald Trump, Mr Kenny said he was “a maniac”
“He really is a maniac,” he said
“He’s a very dangerous individual
He’s probably one of the most divisive people in the world today
He’s everything that an American president shouldn’t be
“I mean, his Republican predecessors – George Bush jnr and Ronald Reagan – they come from the same ilk: they’re psychopaths
Any time that man comes here there should be a huge protest against him
Mr Kenny also said he did not believe criminalising men was the right way to deal with prostitution, and that had he been brought up in Belfast during the troubles he would have joined the IRA

Solidarity-PBP TD Gino Kenny could face censure in the Dáil if Ceann Comhairle Seán Ó Fearghaíl takes action and brings the complaint further after the outburst in the chamber
Mr Kenny, speaking to the Irish Examiner, said he would not withdraw the remark which he said was made out of frustration when his bill to legalise medicinal cannabis was shelved by a committee
The incident occurred after an Oireachtas Health Committee last month said the proposed legislation had too many flaws and should be abandoned
Its report said the bill poses “major legal issues, unintended policy consequences and a lack of safeguards against harmful use of cannabis by patients”
While Mr Kenny had proposed decriminalisation of cannabis for medicinal use, the committee feared that such a move could do the same for recreational use
Mr Kenny then locked horns with the Ceann Comhairle, in the Dáil, saying: “This place is a kip
Mr Kenny said it was “horrendous” that he found out his bill on medicinal cannabis was being rejected on national radio
Mr Ó Fearghaíl wrote to the opposition TD in the last two weeks asking for the withdrawal
The Ceann Comhairle recognised Mr Kenny had been emotional and angry over the Bill being rejected, despite the fact it had passed the initial Dail stage
But the TD has now replied to the Dáil chairman refusing his request
“There was the context why I called the Dáil a kip
The bill was sabotaged, it was outrageous
I stand by what I said
I take the Dáil very serious, I’m very proud of being a TD
But the way the Bill was rejected is an affront to democracy, I would like to think the person who puts a bill forward is given some courtesy, rather than hearing about it on radio
Mr Kenny confirmed the Ceann Comhairle had taken issue with the language he used and said the Dáil should not be called a kip, adding that the TD would be given an opportunity to withdraw it
Mr Kenny maintains that an alternative cannabis programme proposed by Health Minister Simo Harris is too restrictive and ignores scientific advice on the medicinal benefits proposed
He said five other countries in the EU have adopted legislation similar to that contained in his bill, as have countries such as Canada, Australia, and a number of states in the US

https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/oireachtas/minister-rejects-claim-he-has-blood-on-hands-over-israeli-drone-procurement-1.3491141
Minister of State for Defence Paul Kehoe has rejected accusations that he has "blood on his hands" over the purchase of drones from an Israeli manufacturer, amid claims the machinery was tested in Palestinian areas
Mr Kehoe said his main priority was to purchase the best equipment for Defence Force personnel, adding that People Before Profit TD Gino Kenny “would say I had blood on my hands” if personnel went on missions with equipment that was not the very best
Between 2007 and 2009, the State bought four drones or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) from Aeronautics Defence Systems Ltd, based in Israel, at a cost of €2.375 million, excluding VAT
In 2016, the manufacturer upgraded the systems for €19 million before VAT and the Minister said the drones were “an information-gathering asset with no offensive capability”

A day is a long time in politics
Yesterday outgoing Solidarity/People Before Profit TD Gino Kenny said on Twitter that it was not looking good for his re-election
Fast forward a few hours and late last night he was tweeting that "it looks like I might still be in with a shout, battling with Fianna Fáil's John Curran for the last seat
The Phoenix is rising again"
The Phoenix did rise from the political ashes in Dublin Mid West and Gino Kenny remarkably held his seat this afternoon
Looking at the national picture, there are now more than 130 Dáil seats out of 160 filled and the make-up of the 33rd Dáil is becoming clearer
Fine Gael has had a bad election but the party mood will have been lifted this afternoon after it picked up two seats that had hung in the balance
First-time TD Emer Higgins has taken a seat in Dublin Mid West and veteran TD Bernard Durkan has held on Kildare North
Cabinet Ministers Paschal Donohoe and Richard Bruton have also been re-elected
But party strategists will also be disappointed that the party has failed to win a seat in Tipperary for the second election running
By this early evening the party had won 19 seats, but it has had some major casualties, including Regina Doherty, Michael D'Arcy, Pat Breen, Pat Deering, Mary Mitchell O'Connor, Tom Neville, Kate O'Connell and Noel Rock
Other seats are in grave danger
Fianna Fáil looks on course to become the largest party in the next Dáil
Among the TDs to secure seats this afternoon were Darragh O'Brien in Dublin Fingal, James Lawless in Kildare North, Jackie Cahill in Tipperary, Cathal Crowe in Clare and James Browne in Wexford
The party has also had its casualties in an election where it expected to perform better
So far it has lost Malcolm Byrne, who was only elected in a by-election in Wexford last November
Some high profile losses (L-R) Ruth Coppinger, Shane Ross, Lisa Chambers, Regina Doherty, Joan Burton and Mary Mitchell O'Connor
Other surprise seat losses came with Shane Cassells in Meath West, Lisa Chambers in Mayo, John Curran in Dublin Mid-West, Eugene Murphy in Roscommon-Galway, Margaret Murphy O'Mahony in Cork South West, Kevin O'Keeffe in Cork East and Frank O'Rourke in Kildare North, Timmy Dooley in Clare and Declan Breathnach in Louth
Sinn Féin's historic election performance continues with the party up to 37 Dáil seats by 6
Martin Browne in Tipperary, Réada Cronin in Kildare North and Violet Anne Wynne in Clare became the latest to join the Sinn Féin Dáil team
The Green party has won ten seats so far
Malcolm Noonan in Carlow-Kilkenny, Patrick Costello in Dublin South-Central and Neasa Hourigan in Dublin Central are among the Green seats won this afternoon
Former Labour party TD Michael McNamara has won a seat as an Independent in Clare
The Social Democrats has had four TDs elected
After narrowly missing out in 2016, Gary Gannon has won a seat in Dublin Central
Jennifer Whitmore in Wicklow is also expected to win a seat later
Outgoing Independents4Change TD Joan Collins has held her seat
Solidarity/People Before Profit TDs Brid Smith and Richard Boyd Barrett also retained their seats
That grouping has given us one of the stories of this election with Gino Kenny's resurrection

A TD who says he hopes a proposed 'right to die' bill can be legislated for next spring, "or possibly even a referendum"
The bill to legislate for assisted dying is to move to the committee stage, after being passed in the Dáil on Wednesday night
The Dying with Dignity Bill would allow people with terminal illnesses to end their lives
TDs voted in favour of the legislation by 81 votes to 70, after Government TDs were allowed a free vote
The Government had wanted a special committee to be set up to examine the bill, but that proposal was defeated
Dublin-West People Before Profit TD Gino Kenny proposed the bill
He explained to Newstalk Breakfast what limited circumstances it could be used in
"The limited circumstances would be those that has a terminal illness that is incurable and progressive, and that will lead to that person's death
"They're the parameters of the bill"
He also said the bill will not take illnesses not considered terminal - such as multiple sclerosis or chronic pain syndrome - into account
"In relation to advanced age, anybody suffering from mental health issues, disability that doesn't come into the legislation at all
"The safeguards are there, there's a huge oversight in relation to the bill itself
"And obviously the bill when it goes to the committee stage can be changed, and it will
"Opposition bills when they do go to this next stage - it's called pre-legislative scrutiny - they can be changed, sometimes dramatically
"So we're open to that"
'We need scrutiny'
Asked if he was surprised how quickly this passed in the Dáil, he said: "I knew it was going to be close, especially with a vote of conscience
"The last few days I was thinking maybe the amendments was going to be successful, which in principal I wasn't against
"We need scrutiny and we need oversight, and we need all the voices to be heard in relation to this"
He said issues will be teased out across several areas, with witnesses from "the medical side
the legal side and probably the most important side: the patient side where somebody's in that situation"
Asked about concerns over opposition from the medical community, he said: "I think that evolves all the time, and other jurisdictions where the law has changed that have evolved
"And where doctors have come to the conclusion that patients' choice should be taken into account
"It evolves all the time, Ciara, this situation - even take the medical side out of it - evolves even politically
"I think people change their minds over time and say 'Look it, in this situation who am I to say to stop somebody to make that decision?'
"And that's what it comes down to"
Deputy Kenny said he is hopeful a report will be laid to the Oireachtas in early spring next year to be legislated for, "or possibly even a referendum"
'I am fully in support of this bill'
Patient advocate and cervical cancer campaigner Vicky Phelan has previously said she will campaign for the bill
Speaking to Newstalk last month, she said: "I am fully in support of this bill - I was approached by Gino Kenny sometime over the summer
"He told me that he was going to take on this bill and bring it forward and introduce it to the Dáil when they return in September, and wanted to know would I support him with campaigning for this bill to be brought forward
"And I said 'absolutely' - I have a huge vested interest in this, I've done a number of articles about it already, and to be honest even before I was diagnosed with cancer I would have been in favour of it
Vicky Phelan her way into the Dail in 2019 to hear the Taoiseach apologise to the victims of the CervicalCheck controversy
"I have seen people, family members, die who had been terminally ill with cancer
"And I think until you see that, you don't realise how much pain and suffering some people are in
"And while I strongly support palliative care - they do fantastic work - I do recognise that it cannot relieve all end-stage suffering
"There is a period towards the end, particularly with some particular cancers, that it's very hard to control the pain - and mine is one of those cancers

The Dying With Dignity bill will move to committee stage having been passed in the Dáil
The bill, proposed by People Before Profit TD Gino Kenny, was given a free vote by the government and passed by 81 votes to 71
It will move to the third stage of drafting, where it will be discussed by Oireachtas committees
A government amendment which would have sent the bill to an all-party committee for 12 months was defeated
The bill would allow those over 18 who cannot recover from their illness to make provision to receive a dignified death
It would require two medical practitioners, including one independent doctor, to agree that the person meets the criteria
It has been supported by cancer campaigner Vicky Phelan, who has pleaded with TDs to afford her a dignified death
This evening she tweeted: "THANK YOU to ALL 81 TDs who voted for the #dyingwithdignitybill to go to the next stage
"I cannot thank (Gino Kenny), (Bríd Smith)  and (People Before Profit)  enough for proposing the Bill
"To Labour, Sinn Féin, The Social Democrats for supporting it all the way
To ALL Green Party  TDs
Thank you
"To the 10 Fine Gael and 4 Fianna Fáil TDs who voted with their conscience, a massive THANK YOU Finally, to the Irish people who supported this Bill and contacted TDs and made this possible, I thank you most sincerely
"There is a long way to go and the Bill will require lots of scrutiny and amendments to ensure that vulnerable patients and medical practitioners are protected BUT today is a good day for democracy

https://www.thejournal.ie/legislation-personal-use-of-cannabis-ireland-5917349-Nov2022/
A BILL THAT would legalise the personal use of cannabis is set to go before the Dáil in around two weeks
The Bill was due to be introduced during the summer but was delayed, Gino Kenny of People Before Profit said
The Dublin Mid-West TD told The Journal it is a relatively short bill, and will amend the current legislation on possession of cannabis, which is the Misuse of Drugs Act
The amendment doesn’t reference the cultivation of cannabis
It’s anticipated that if the bill is approved by the Dáil – which means it requires the approval of the government parties – then changes regarding cultivation of cannabis could be added at committee stage
“The Bill will end the criminalisation of cannabis for personal use,” said Kenny
“People Before Profit is for complete regulation but this is a stepping stone to that
This bill will make it legal for someone to possess up to 7g of cannabis
” He said this is on par with legislation in Malta and Luxembourg
Kenny said that the amendment will bring no financial burden on the State
“It is legally permissible to put this bill forward under European law we’ve been told [by legal advisors],” he said
“The only impediment is the government could try to block it going forward, but we hope to have a good discussion around the issue
I think it’s time to have a discussion around drug reform in Ireland, particularly around personal use
Kenny said that the Bill will test the government, in terms of it having a health-led approach to harm reduction
While the Bill is focused on cannabis, PBP is supportive of decriminalising drugs in Ireland
Asked how he thinks the Bill will go, Kenny said: “Some parties don’t have a position on decriminalisation so it will be interesting to see how they go for it
He called on members of the Green Party to support the bill
“I think there’s an appetite in this country to have a different debate on drug use,” added Kenny
“There is a groundswell of opinion in Ireland that we need to do something different than what we are doing
I think there is a majority of people that believe we should be doing something different
Criminalising people doesn’t work – it’s counter-productive in my eyes
He said that the focus should be on harm reduction, and looking at ways to stop criminalising the use of drugs
“The system we have now, it simply doesn’t work and it enriches a tiny amount of people in society
It brings all sorts of people into the criminal justice system and I think the resources of the State would be better spent in relation to taking people away from the criminal justice system
In a previous interview with The Journal, Kenny said that once legalised, cannabis should be sold in regulated settings which would limit the sale of it for profit
The Green Party previously called for the introduction of Dutch-style “coffee shops” to Ireland that would allow the consumption and sale of cannabis for over-18s under certain conditions
Green Party leader Eamon Ryan told TheJournal
ie four years ago that he thought such coffee shops would work here

People Before Profit TD Gino Kenny says he "will not be intimidated" by members of Ireland's far-right who have threatened to come to his home
Mr Kenny was involved in a confrontation with an anti-refugee protester last week in a scene that was live-streamed on social media
The Dublin Mid-West TD joined a counter-demonstration after a number of people protested at a temporary centre in Clondalkin
During the protest, videos show Mr Kenny being called "dirt" and a "traitor to the Irish people"
Since then, Mr Kenny has been frequently mentioned in far-right and anti-refugee social media chats
In a statement, Mr Kenny said that his home has been threatened, and lies have been spread about him
"On Thursday I attended a counter-protest to those who are protesting outside a temporary centre for international protection applicants in Clondalkin," he said
Since then, the far-right has been targeting me and my family
They've spread lies about me and threatened to come to my home
"It is sinister, and it needs to be called out
The far-right function on fear and intimidation — they target asylum seekers where they live, they spread lies, and threaten anyone who stands up to them
"I will not be intimidated
I will continue to challenge the hatred of the far-right and I encourage those in my community and across the island to do the same
The protest in Clondalkin was one of a number of sparsely-attended anti-refugee protests around the country in what was billed as a "day of action" by organisers
Residents at the Clondalkin centre had been warned to stay off the streets during the protest

Gino Kenny says it is “important” that the People Before Profit Cannabis Regulation Bill is passed if the government is “serious” about reflecting the recommendations of the Citizens’ Assembly on Drug Use
The Dublin TD has been a vocal supporter of the regulation and legislation of cannabis, having previously introduced a bill for the medicinal use of cannabis and most recently introduced a bill that would enable a person who is at least 18 years of age to have possession for the person’s personal use
Gino brought the bill forward in November 2022, the bill is currently before Dáil Éireann in the second stage and must now be debated in the Dáil
Speaking to the Irish Mirror, the People Before Profit Dublin Mid-West TD explained that the party will be using their private members' time in January to hold a two-hour debate and then a vote on the bill
Gino said: “We are going to use our private members' time because obviously, the Citizens’ Assembly have recommended decriminalisation for personal drug use
“In those circumstances, we have decided to use our private members' time in January to have a two-hour debate and then a vote
“Hopefully, the government won’t vote against our bill and will let it go through, letting it go through does not mean it will be legislated for but it will certainly be a positive measure to the issue of decriminalisation and reflect on what the Citizens’ Assembly has said
In October, the members of the Citizens’ Assembly on Drug Use voted to recommend the end of the current laws criminalising people caught with illegal substances for personal use, opting for a comprehensive health-led strategy
The vote for cannabis was the closest - with just one vote in the difference between a health-led approach and legalisation and regulation
Chairperson Paul Reid speaking at The Citizens' Assembly on Drugs Use
Chairperson Paul Reid speaking at The Citizens' Assembly on Drugs Use
Gino says that if the government are serious about reflecting what the Citizens’ Assembly have recommended then “it's important that the legislation goes through”
“There were over 30 recommendations from the Citizens’ Assembly, and some of them didn’t call for legislative change, obviously, for decriminalisation you would need to change the law in relation to the Misuse of Drugs Act
“On this occasion we are only speaking about cannabis, we're not speaking about any other drugs
“I think it's important if the government is serious, if they are serious about reflecting what the Citizens Assembly have said then it's important that the legislation goes through
Gino explained that given the recommendations of the Citizens’ Assembly, there is no reason why the government would vote against this bill
“Obviously, there is a variety of opinions around this issue
I think public opinion is ahead of the government, as was reflected by the Citizens’ Assembly
“Given that and that the Citizens’ Assembly has voted to recommend decriminalisation, there's no reason why the government would vote against it
It would look absolutely farcical if they did, then what is the whole idea of the Citizens’ Assembly
“That doesn’t mean it will be legislated for, but it would be a big step if the government wouldn’t oppose it and let it go to the committee stage
The Dublin TD says that while the Misuse of Drugs (Cannabis Regulation) Bill introduced last year is a “very moderate bill” and that he would “rather see it being legislated and regulated” - this bill is a “stepping stone toward regulation”
“It's a very moderate bill,” he explained
“Our party has a position on legalisation and regulation
In terms of being a moderate bill, this is kind of this is the bottom in some ways where the least you could recommend
“Obviously, I would rather see it being legislated and regulated but this is decriminalisation in the guise that cannabis is still illegal, under the Misuse Of Drugs Act, but I think this is a stepping stone toward regulation

Hot Press' opinion being that it's typical prevarication from a government that didn't need a Citizens' Assembly to fix our clearly broken drug laws
People Before Profit TD Gino Kenny has castigated the government for imposing a nine-month timed amendment to his The Misuse of Drugs (Cannabis Regulation) Bill 2022, which passed its first reading in November '22 unopposed and would decriminalise the possession of up to 7 grams of cannabis and 2
5 grams of cannabis resin
Speaking at this morning's Taoiseach's Questions in the Dáil, Leo Varadkar proffered: "I met with the Chairman of the Citizens' Assembly on Drugs Policy last week, and there are three takeaways for me from what he said
One is that we need an Irish model – we shouldn't just try and copy models from other countries
Another is that they've made a lot of recommendations, it's not just about decriminalisation
He doesn't want all the focus to be on that
And if it's going to be examined by an Oireachtas Committee, it should be a Special Committee, not the Health Committee or the Justice Committee because it's relevant to both areas and, indeed, other areas like Education
So our intention is to refer the report to a Special Oireachtas Committee
We'll bring a memo to Cabinet about that next week
One of the things the Special Oireachtas Committee will have to tease out is what does decriminalisation really mean in a legal context
Reacting to the Taoiseach, a disappointed Gino Kenny says: "Passing this bill today would have allowed it to go to the committee stage where we could have had this conversation and actually started taking meaningful first steps towards realising the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly
Despite the recommendations for decriminalisation and a health lead approach from the Citizens' Assembly the government opted to kick the can down the road another nine months
In the Daíl to support Kenny was MEP Luke 'Ming' Flanagan whose previous Cannabis Regulation Bill was heavily defeated in 2013, but made cannabis an increasingly mainstream political issue
"No one in the Dáil press gallery for the debate on cannabis," he rues
"What's that about? There will be thousands of stories written in national, regional and local newspapers in the next year on cannabis convictions
So obviously it's considered news to them
Why then the no show?
"Searched the word 'Cannabis' on IT and Indo websites
6,997 articles on Irish Times page
10,000 on Indo page
But it still isn't of enough interest to them to turn up in person when a TD proposes legislation which would change the status quo on a law relating to cannabis
Why?"
Ming went on to add: No one from the Green Party bothered to contribute to a the Dáil debate on cannabis and the misuse of drugs
A party that claims to agree with change
Why say it and then run away from it? Pathetic
Nothing new from them
It now seems highly likely that a full addressing of the Citizens' Assembly on Drugs Policy's recommendations won't happen until after the General Election
Hot Press' opinion being that it's typical prevarication from a government that didn't need a Citizens' Assembly to fix our clearly broken drug laws
We'd also point to the pilot Dublin Supervised Injecting Facility green-lit by government in 2015 and yet to open with likely hundreds suffering overdose deaths as a result
Bottom line is that it's not just a priority for Leo or Michéal
The delay to Gino Kenny's bill comes in the same week that the Mayor of Amsterdam, Femke Halsema, categorically stated that the War On Drugs can't be won and, in addition to cannabis, called for the regulation of cocaine, ecstasy and other drugs in Holland, and suggestions that Finland might be moving towards the legalisation of cannabis

A People Before Profit TD for Dublin Mid-West met with the Parents Association of Lucan Community College to highlight the lack of progress for the proposed extension at the college, writes Rachel Cunningham
The process has been ongoing for the past sixteen years, the association has stated, with over 800 pupils attending the schoolat present and a waiting list for new entrants
The refurbishment would include additional classrooms and educational spaces and an upgrade to the school, which was built over 40 years ago
“I completely agree with the Parents Association frustration with the lack of progress on the refurbishment of Lucan Community College,” said People Before Profit TD Gino Kenny
“They acknowledge that the building process is atsStage three and the tendering process is underway
“The lack of transparency and urgency is affecting pupils, teachers, and parents
“I have written to the Minister for Education requesting that the department give a clear timeline on when the works will begin
It’s imperative that this happens immediately

People Before Profit representatives in Clondalkin have welcomed the establishment of a Citizen’s Assembly on Drugs, writes Rachel Cunningham
The assembly will examine the wider issue of drugs and the impact on drug use on local communities
It will consist of 99 randomly selected citizens and an independent chairperson
“The issue of drugs has had a huge impact on communities like Neilstown in Clondalkin, where I’m from,” said Gino Kenny
Councillor Madeleine Johansson added: “I have been on the board of the Clondalkin Drugs and Alcohol Task Force since 2019 and I have seen the great work that is done by projects in the area
“But it has also convinced me that we need to change the way we think about drugs and start treating addiction as a health issue, not a criminal issue
“If the money that was spent through the criminal justice system was diverted into local communities and services it could make a big difference to peoples lives
I took part in the Citizens Assembly on a Directly Elected Mayor for Dublin and I found the process very enlightening and I want to wish the participants the best of luck

People Before Profit TD Gino Kenny has highlighted his concern over planning decisions in the constituency following a number of planning decisions being reversed by An Bord Pleanála over the past year
“There are serious questions to be asked about the accountability of An Bord Pleanála and the planning process as a whole
Our heritage and communities are being railroaded in the financial interest of property developers”,  the Dublin Mid-West commented
The TD also criticised applications that had been granted by South Dublin County Council, which he claimed, “raised serious questions”
Last week, a decision was made by An Bord Pleanála to grant permission on appeal to Cavan Developments for 98 units in Rathcoole
Mr Kenny commented: “I have been talking to constituents in Rathcoole who are very disappointed that a decision by the council was overturned by An Bord Pleanála
Residents feel let down by the planning authorities, and I don’t blame them
“The developer, Cavan Developments, has failed to complete units to provide much needed amenities, such as retail units and a GP surgery in the area
The council planners raised serious concerns about their application to build another 98 homes beside Rath Mills including overdevelopment of the site and substandard public open space
“But An Bord Pleanála has overturned that decision in favour of the developer to the detriment of the local community
Mr Kenny highlighted the pattern that is emerging, citing An Bord Pleanála’s decision to overturn South Dublin County Council’s refusal of a plan to demolish Floraville Cottage in Clondalkin Village and to construct apartments on the site, saying that “a heritage building with connections to James Joyce is now lost forever
People Before Profit Councillor Madeleine Johansson noted that council planners have a “much better understanding of the local area”, stating that An Bord Pleanála consistently overturning decisions made by South Dublin County Council planners and “railroading” local decision making is not fit for purpose

People Before Profit TD Gino Kenny has said he is hopeful politicians will move forward with laws that would allow people with a terminal illness to opt for assisted death
An Oireachtas committee set up to consider the issue of assisted dying has completed its legal deliberations and will hear next from people who have the “lived experience” of terminal illness
The 14-member Joint Committee on Assisted Dying (JCAD) held its final meeting last week
In September, it will hear from people directly affected by terminal illness on whether they support the prospect of assisted dying in certain circumstances
The committee, made up of TDs and senators, is also due to hear from experts from New Zealand and the US, where assisted dying has been introduced
Once it has completed all its hearings, the committee will submit a detailed report to the Government on whether it supports the prospect of assisted dying in terminal cases
In October 2020, the Dying with Dignity Bill, proposed by Mr Kenny, progressed to committee stage, having been passed in the Dáil
If it becomes law, it will allow those over 18 who cannot recover from their illness to make provision to receive a “dignified death”
It would require two medical practitioners, including an independent doctor, to agree the person meets the criteria
​Mr Kenny said the committee has discussed six modules to date, and it has been “very informative and interesting” to hear perspectives on the controversial issue
“We now know that we don’t need a referendum on this issue
It would need a constitutional reform to change the law, if that is what the committee recommends,” he said
“We do not know what the committee will recommend yet
I support assisted dying in certain circumstances and I hope the committee will recommend a change to the law
“But it is up to the committee as a whole to make a recommendation
After that, it will be up to the government of the day to act, or not, on its recommendations
A patient who was diagnosed with stage-four cancer during the pandemic joined growing calls for support for the Dying with Dignity Bill
Niall Dynan, who was then 46, told the Sunday Independent in October 2020 that he “would like the choice” if his suffering became too much, not just for him to endure but for his loved-ones to witness
Mr Dynan got in touch with Mr Kenny when he became aware of the proposed law
He died in July 2021 as a result of his illness
Speaking from his Tipperary home in 2020, Mr Dynan said: “It boils down to leaving on your own terms
I try to stay as positive as possible, but if things did go bad I would like to have the choice
A plant fitter and welder by trade, Mr Dynan became aware of the Dying with Dignity Bill through the publicity generated by CervicalCheck campaigner Vicky Phelan, who pleaded with TDs to allow assisted dying before her own death last November
Mr Dynan, who was originally from Co Cork, said previously: “I was diagnosed with stage-four oesophageal cancer in June
It’s a grim outlook, but I’m trying to stay as positive as possible
That is one of the most important things
“I’m 46
It was a huge shock
I was completely spun out about it for the first two or three weeks, but there comes a time when you just have to deal with it
With this type of cancer you are asymptomatic until it’s too late
Surgery is not an option

https://www.collegetribune.ie/td-gino-kenny-discusses-path-to-legalising-cannabis/
On Wednesday the 16th of November, People Before Profit/Solidarity TD, Gino Kenny, hosted a discussion in the FitzGerald Chamber
In this discussion he outlined his proposition to decriminalise the possession of up to 7 grams of cannabis
What would be an amendment of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977, Kenny argues that the criminalisation of cannabis “is criminal itself” and enables the strengthening of criminal organisations involved in cultivating and distributing the drug nationwide
What will begin at the end of November with the proposition of the bill before the Dáil, Kenny expressed his hope that it would become the first of a series of bills to regulate cannabis, the next of which will tackle the decriminalisation of sale and cultivation
In the event of legalisation, Kenny advocates for the distribution of cannabis within “regulated spaces,” such as dispensaries reminiscent of coffeeshop establishments in the Netherlands
The majority of these spaces will be managed via “a not-for-profit system where the state controls the sale and supply
In April 2018, the Green Party expressed a similar sentiment stating that the current law has “made criminals out of decent people
” This comment was backed by leader Eamon Ryan who expressed his belief to TheJournal
ie that a coffeeshop culture would work throughout the country
For Kenny, regulated spaces will allow for the safer handling of cannabis, such as enabling the buyer to choose the amount of the THC content included – the core psychoactive component of cannabis
Furthermore, whilst distribution via the black market includes the risk of cannabis products being laced with unknown substances, Kenny notes that this would no longer be of concern in regulated spaces
The proposition coincides with what Kenny has described as a “renaissance” surrounding the stigma of cannabis
It his hope that the bill will challenge beliefs such as cannabis being “a gateway drug to the heart of drugs” and illuminate how the true gateway toward harder drugs is rather “poverty and alienation
However, Kenny did address issues surrounding the possibility of cannabis dependency, noting that there can be “problematic use” in which users can become reliant on the drug
In a climate of decriminalisation, Kenny argues that the financial gain from the regulation of cannabis can be used for “more progressive things,” such as aid for those suffering from substance dependency
When questioned about the status of individuals with past criminal offenses relating to cannabis, Kenny supported the recent measures taken by U
President Joe Biden in which prisoners charged with “simple possession” of the drug were pardoned
As part of the legalisation drive, Kenny aspires to propose a future bill tackling the expunging of criminal offenses of up to thirty years related to cannabis, including the removal any records of past offences
As of now, the Republic of Ireland has legalised the possession of medical cannabis through the Medical Cannabis Access Programme
Despite Minister of Health, Stephen Donnelly, expressing his hope for the programme to “grow and expand further”, Kenny has described it as being “tortuously slow” and is not yet available for medical issues, such as neuropathic pain

It said: "On Thursday I attended a counter protest to those who were protesting outside a temporary centre for international protection applicants in Clondalkin
I felt it was necessary to counter the lies being spread by members of the far right and ensure that those seeking asylum were not intimidated
"Since then, the far right has been targeting me and my family
They have spread lies about me and threatened to come to my home
It is sinister and it needs to be called out
"The far right function on fear and intimidation
They target asylum seekers where they live, they spread lies and threaten anyone who stands up to them
I will not be intimidated
I will continue to challenge the outright hatred of the far right and I encourage those in my community and across the island to do the same

IT is "absolute rubbish" that cannabis is a gateway to harder drugs, the Dáil has been told on a Bill to decriminalise simple possession
People Before Profit TD Gino Kenny, who is sponsoring the Bill, was told by Government that he was prejudging the recommendations of the Citizens Assembly, which are to go before a Dáil committee
But Mr Kenny said the Chair of that Assembly, former HSE chief Paul Reid, had said on foot of its deliberations there was "no time to waste" and the State had to change course
He criticised the absence of the Green Party, saying it would vote against his Bill despite previously having a standing policy in favour of what he proposed
Mr Kenny said Danny Healy Rae had once more come out in the debate and described cannabis as a gateway drug
"I find that incredible that he says cannabis is a gateway drug - he owns a pub
" The remark drew laughter from the public gallery, with cannabis campaigner Luke 'Ming' Flanagan MEP in attendance
Alcohol was a psychoactive substance and "most people do drink in this country," some to a problematic extent, Mr Kenny said
"And they die
"And alcohol has a lot to answer for in this country
It's a legal drug
I can walk out of this chamber and into two bars next door that are serving me alcohol as much as I want
"Alcohol kills four people a day in this country and contributes to 40pc of all deaths
If we were go down the road of making alcohol illegal, it would put the drugs wars into the ha'penny place
"The issue that always really annoys me is that cannabis is a gateway to harder drugs
Absolute rubbish
Absolute rubbish that it's a gateway to harder drugs
"It's the usual tropes of stigmatisation and just rhetoric that can be used against people who like to use drugs like cannabis
Danny Healy-Rae had earlier told the debate: "We can see that cannabis use has been on the rise for nearly two decades
"While some of the people in favour of the Bill will say that it is not a serious or bad drug in itself, it is the gateway and stepping stone to harder drugs

CHILDREN are ending up in hospital with psychosis due to dangerously potent cannabis which is “not the drug it was 20 years ago”, the Dail has heard
Ireland’s cannabis laws were debated in the Dail for the first time in over a decade today as People Before Profit tried to decriminalise the possession of less than seven grams of cannabis for personal use
TDs heard how the potency of cannabis has become dangerous in recent years
There was widespread support for Dublin TD Gino Kenny’s bill in order to progress the debate on Ireland’s drug laws and policies
However, despite commitments to move to a more health led approach to drugs, the Government kicked the can down the road by moving an amendment that will put the bill on ice for nine months
The Dail debate today heard a wide range of opinions and experiences on cannabis from TDs – except the Green Party who did not contribute despite their own policy of decriminalising cannabis possession for personal use
Independent TD Matt Shanahan said that criminalising people for drug use is not the way forward however, he warned of the dangers of cannabis
Read more on cannabis
He told the Dail that he knew one 18-year-old man who had his chances of moving to the US to play sport scuppered because he has a conviction for the possession of cannabis
The Waterford TD also told how he had two friends who were regular cannabis smokers when they were younger – one of which has died from heroin while the other is struggling with a cocaine addiction
He warned that Ireland is seeing a lot more children in hospital because they are suffering from psychosis as a result of cannabis
He said: “There is a lot of medical evidence to suggest that cannabis and cannabis resin is not the drug is was 20 or 30 years ago
Sinn Fein’s Mark Ward – who previously worked in addiction centres – told the Dail that about the dangers of cannabis that he saw in one service in Dublin that he managed
He said: “The majority of the young people that were accessing the service were young men between the ages of 16 and 25
“Many had left school, lost jobs, become involved in criminality, lost family relationships and owed out huge amounts of drug deaths
“This was very similar to the heroin epidemic in the 80s but this time the only drug that these young people were using was cannabis
“Cannabis has been modified over the years to increase the THC levels, to reduce the CBD levels which has led to increased potencies and has led to a range of negative impacts including the mental health
“We’ve seen many young people experiencing psychosis for the first time because of the potency of cannabis
The Dail also heard stories of how young people were being left with “career ending” criminal convictions for being caught in possession of less than one gram of cannabis
This conviction was preventing them from getting certain jobs and even travelling to certain countries in some instances
Some 5,900 charges of drug possession were issued in 2021, the Dail heard as TDs claimed cases of possession of small amounts of cannabis was wasting garda time and resources
Several TDs spoke out against the decriminalisation of cannabis including Kerry publican Danny Healy Rae who called for more education for young people about the dangers of drugs
'War on drugs'
People Before Profit’s Gino Kenny defended his Bill as he claimed there was no evidence to suggest that cannabis was a gateway drug
He said that the availability of all drugs has increased since the “war on drugs” policy began in the 1970s as he claimed: “You can’t policy your way out of this
He added: “My life experience from growing up in Clondalkin and I’ve seen the terrible dark side to addiction, terrible dark side
“What happens to the individual and what happens to communities and what happens to society as a whole in relation to the dark side of drugs
“We can all acknowledge that but my life experience says that continually criminalising people, continually putting people in prison, continually wasting vast resources in containment into jailing people into bringing people through the criminal justice system – it doesn’t work
A Citizen’s Assembly on Drug policy recently recommended that Ireland move towards a health led decriminalisation model
A motion to fully legalise and regulate cannabis was also defeated at the Assembly by just one vote

Gino Kenny say prohibition and criminalisation for personal use has failed
Clondalkin based TD Gino Kenny is calling on the government to back the Cannabis Regulation Bill he’ll be bringing to the Dail next week
It comes on the back of 36 recommendations published by Citizens’ Assembly, which Deputy Kenny welcomes, saying prohibition and criminalisation for personal use has failed
The People Before Profit rep said: “I want to endorse the comments of the chair of the Citizens’ Assembly Paul Reid
Ireland urgently needs to move to a system where drugs for personal use are decriminalised
“For decades we have had a policy where the justice system, the courts, the prions services, and Garda resources have had their time wasted with the war on drugs, and people’s lives continue to be severely impacted
"Prohibition and criminalisation for personal use has failed
"Drug use is everywhere in society
We need to have a more thought-out approach that treats drug use as a health issue
“I am confident that the recommendations of the Citizens’ Assembly will recommend progressive change
It is now incumbent on the government to introduce progressive legislative change in this area
“Next week I will bring a private members bill to the Dáil which would decriminalise cannabis for personal use
I am calling on the government to back this bill so it can progress and become law
